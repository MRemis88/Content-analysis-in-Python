About this Report
The information in this report covers all activities, products, and services by the Group and all companies that are consolidated according to
the regulations on financial reporting issued by the International Accounting Standards Board on the balance sheet date or have significant
environmental effects within this framework.
The financial, HR, and environmental key figures are calculated at the Group level via an SAP-supported application and are subject to the
same calculation method. Different collection methods are indicated in individual cases. All data and information was collected by the
relevant departments/consolidated Group companies.
The Fraport Group is among the leading global airport operators with Frankfurt Airport and its international portfolio of investments. The
range of the Group includes all services of aviation and terminal operations as well as associated services.
The Group’s most important revenue and profit driver is Frankfurt Airport. With a share of just over 80 % of revenue and more than 63 % of
the Group result, the German site – and here almost exclusively Frankfurt Airport – was again the most important site of the Fraport Group
in 2015. Over 90 % of employees were employed in Germany/at the Frankfurt site in 2015.
Our reports “GRI Report 2015” and “2015 Compact – Gute Reise! We make it happen” are published annually in German and English and
cover the reporting period of January 1 to December 31 of each year.
The usual, and in our opinion appropriate, methods, calculations, and estimates are employed to determine the reporting data. It cannot
be excluded that individual GRI indicators may be associated with a degree of uncertainty. A summary of all key figures is found in our
financial report.

In 2012 the figure for hydrocarbons was calculated from 12 individual samples and the value of “settleable solids” from 11 individual samples.
2)
	The increase in 2014 compared with the previous year is due to a high figure in July.
This was preceded by days with very high rainfall that washed out deposits from the drains.

*)	Population database DDS. Collection date for this data for all analyses is 2010. The update of the population database to the status as per 2010 for the years to 2014
compared with earlier publications results in minor changes to inhabitant numbers in the relevant contours.
1)
The flight noise contours were calculated based on the reference works introduced for Germany “Instructions for calculating noise abatement areas (AzB)” and “Instructions
for capturing flight operations data (AzD, 2008)”. All scenarios were standardized based on the average operation direction distribution for the 10 years from 2000 to 2009.
The sigma increase developed for forecasting protection zone calculations under the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act and described in AzB and AzD was not used.
2)
	For the Ldn (level day/night) measure, this is a 24h long-term noise level in dB(A) that adds an increase of 10 dB to noise events at night. The Ldn enables us to document
pollution changes from year to year using only one criterion.
3)
The Leq, day = 60 dB(A) criterion is aligned with the definition of day protection zone 1 pursuant to the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.
4)
The Leq, day = 55 dB(A) criterion is aligned with the definition of day protection zone 2 pursuant to the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.
5)
	The information on the Leq, day = 55 dB(A) is the total number within this contour that is below the number stated for Leq, day = 60 dB(A), i.e., a sub-quantity.
6)
	The criterion Surrounding from NAT, night = 6 x 68 dB(A) and Leq, night = 50 dB(A) is aligned with the definition of the night protection zone pursuant to the Aircraft Noise
Abatement Act.

was extended to include the Group companies AMU Holdings Inc. (USA) and, from October 2014, Ljubljana Airport (Slovenia). Furthermore,
Fraport sold its shares in the Group company Air-Transport IT Services, Inc., USA with effect as at April 22, 2015. On November 2, 2015
Fraport sold 51 % of the capital shares in Group company Fraport Cargo Services (FCS). These two companies are no longer included in

Minor injuries (at the level of first-aid measures) are not included.				
2)
Notifiable = occupational accidents resulting in more than three lost days must be reported.				
3)
	With reference to the average headcount. The average headcount is calculated by adding the total monthly employees divided by the number of months.		
4)
Absence days = planned work days. 				
5)
Based on planned working hours.				
6)
It is not currently possible for Fraport to classify accidents by cause for technical reasons, but this is a target for the future.		
7)
	The figures shown cover all staff, but not independent contractors, as no data are collected for these employees.				
8)
	Sub-dividing the accident and absence days is not relevant for Fraport. The majority of workplace accidents take place in operational areas where mainly men work. An analysis would therefore show that the majority are men.

GRI Content Index
Our 2015 sustainability reporting comprises the report “2015 Compact – Gute Reise! We make it happen” and the GRI Report 2015. The
GRI Report is aligned with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4, “in accordance” Core option) and takes into account
the airport-specific Airport Operators Sector Disclosures.
As part of the conversion of the sustainability reporting to the G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the materiality matrix
needed further development in 2015 (see G4-18). After updating the materiality matrix, the ten areas of action were assigned to the material
GRI G4 aspects. In addition, relevant aspects that are key requirements for operating an airport were determined and these remain part of
the reporting. These aspects are marked accordingly in the report.
Our 2015 sustainability reporting is also used as a progress report relating to the implementation of the ten principles of the UN Global
Compact on corporate management.
The GRI Content Index shows where information on the individual issues and aspects of sustainability reporting can be found.

G4-10 Total workforce
See Key figures/Personnel, G4-10 Total workforce page 17 et seq.
A breakdown of the key figures by gender for the Group sites is not yet possible due to technical reasons, but the aim is to collect these
data in future.

G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
See Key figures/Personnel, G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, page 20.
In the Fraport Group over 99 % of all employees are employed and paid under collective bargaining agreements. The difference to 100 % is
made up of employees of smaller Group companies who are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. These are mainly employees
not covered by collective bargaining agreements or senior managers.

G4-12 Organization’s supply chain
The Fraport Group is a supplier of high-quality airport services. In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, transparency, loyalty, and fairness, we aspire to act with social, economic, and environmental responsibility in
our business dealings and see sustainability as designing the future. We have defined this responsibility for our employees in the code of
conduct. We expect our suppliers and service providers to comply with the same standards. The code of conduct describes the standards
for business relationships with the Fraport AG companies. Similar to the code of conduct for employees, this code addresses the issues
of compliance, working conditions, and human rights and was supplemented by the aspects of environmental conservation and climate
protection.
This applies to all Fraport suppliers and service providers with whom there is a direct business relationship.

Procurement at Fraport AG
Contrary to a manufacturing company, Fraport AG has a heterogeneous requirement structure. The requirements of Fraport AG range from
architectural services through the erection of complete buildings to their repair, from office materials through computer center services to
aircraft tow-tractors. Frankfurt Airport does not have a traditional supply chain.
Around 68 % (€510 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €749 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region in 2015. More than 91 % of all awarded orders were below €10,000 and are therefore to the particular advantage
of small and medium-sized companies.
Around 43 % of the order volume was procured for services. These were mainly services for security, temporary staff, cleaning, and IT.
28 % of the order volume was procured for construction. The other 29 % was placed in the market for consumables.
In 2015 Fraport AG had over 3,208 active suppliers and service providers.
Location of suppliers and service providers by country:
97 % of the order volume comes from suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic of Germany, 2.5 % from
within the EU, and 0.5 % from such countries as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have comparable legal principles and standards.

G4-13 Changes regarding size, structure, or ownership
See Annual Report 2015, page 48 et seqq. and page 58 et seqq.
In 2015 there were no significant changes in terms of suppliers’ sites or relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination.
Fraport does not have a traditional supply chain.

G4-14 Explanation of whether and how the precautionary approach or principle is addressed by
the organization
Fraport actively looks for opportunities and embraces them if the magnitude of the projected benefits and the exposure to risks are in an
appropriate relationship to each other. A controlled approach to risks is the primary goal of risk management (see Annual Report 2015,
page 75 et seqq.).
Furthermore, our business model supports a precautionary approach when dealing with environmental problems and also takes into account
aspects such as cost efficiency, economic feasibility, and sustainability of our environmental programs (see Environmental Statement 2015
in the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com).
A range of comprehensive measures directed toward preventive health and safety are designed to avoid the physical, psychological, and
social forms of stress that employees experience at work as far as possible. If stress cannot be avoided, the preventive measures are intended
to reduce or compensate for it (see “Occupational health and safety” in “2015 Compact”, page 46 et seq. and “Occupational health and
safety” on www.fraport.com). The Executive Board and the employee representative bodies have formulated a statement of principles on
occupational health and safety and incorporated it into the Group guidelines.
Security is a key condition for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and air freight. This is why security management
has always been a top priority for Fraport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed at
Frankfurt Airport to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo. The Security Management System (SMS) at Fraport AG is
an instrument set up in conformity with the ICAO standards and recommendations. It records and evaluates all events relevant to security
in airport operations and potential weak points in the operating processes. The SMS is directed toward all users at Frankfurt Airport; the
relevant processes, procedures, and responsibilities are defined in a manual accessible to all internal personnel.

G4-15 Externally developed charters, principles, or other initiatives
Voluntary initiatives (selection):
Fraport AG has made a commitment to compliance with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote
responsible corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN Global Compact (since July 2007), the OECD principles,
and the ILO core labor standards.–
In addition, Fraport signed the Business Conduct Rules of the biggest European purchasing association, the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (BME) in 2009. The Rules are based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and include
fundamental anti-corruption rules; antitrust agreements; rules on child labor and forced labor; and rules on compliance with human rights,
environmental protection, health protection, and fair working conditions. The companies signing up to the agreement have made a commitment to promote the “Business Conduct Rules” with their suppliers in the best possible way.
The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The Code describes the key
principles for the management and monitoring of the Company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good
and responsible corporate governance. The Fraport Code also includes the key rights of the shareholders who provide the company with
the necessary equity capital and bear the entrepreneurial risk. The Fraport Code is firmly based on the German Corporate Governance Code.
Equal opportunities, diversity, and achieving the right work-life balance for career and family are key elements of our employment policy.
Fraport signed the Charter of Diversity in December 2007.
Since 2002, Fraport has been a member of Transparency International German Chapter e.V. (https://www.transparency.de/English.1222.0.html).
Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI, with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European
airports to adopt CO₂-neutral operation. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be audited in accordance with the rules of Airport Carbon
Accreditation and it was accepted into the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. Fraport has reached
Level 3 “Optimization”. Stakeholder engagement is a key element of this stage. Our investment, Antalya Airport, has also reached Level 3+
“Neutrality”. In 2015, Ljubljana Airport achieved Level 2 “Reduction” by appropriate measures.

Mandatory initiatives:
Reporting is in accordance with the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). As the capital-market oriented
parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
See also indexes, awards, and memberships (http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/innovations-awards/awards.html).

G4-16 Memberships
Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV, http://
www.adv.aero/), Airports Council International (ACI, http://www.aci.aero/), Europe, and World. Fraport is also a member of the Federation
of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL, http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for
Germany and has defined its target as highlighting its contribution to safe mobility, climate, and environmental protection. We are working
together with the bodies there to prepare positions on the issues of air traffic. They also include positions on projected legislation and
political initiatives (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/european-matters-associations/associations.html).

Material Aspects and Boundaries
G4-17 List of consolidated companies
See “Disclosures of shareholding pursuant to Section 313 (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)” and “Notes to the Consolidation
and Accounting Policies” (Annual Report 2015, page 194 et seqq. and page 110 et seqq.)

G4-18 Process for defining the report content
The basis for defining the report content is a materiality matrix analysis. We focus on the principles of completeness, materiality, and stakeholder engagement formulated by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). From the regular and systematic exchange with our internal and
external stakeholders, we gain the impetus for the strategic alignment of the company (see “Stakeholder dialogs” in “2015 Compact”,
page 22 et seqq.). Since 2010, we have used this to create the materiality matrix that depicts the company’s future challenges. The matrix
is updated annually and, if necessary, modified (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 24).
In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines, the materiality matrix needed to
be developed in 2015 to focus it even more on the central areas of action for the company’s sustainability. To be specific, we approached
defining the key issues as follows:

1. Identification
The content of the existing materiality matrix was first checked according to the GRI G4 requirements, taking account of the benchmark
results and discussions with representatives of internal departments. Detailed results from the last management and stakeholder survey
from 2013 were also considered, as well as the current extent to which targets from the “Our program” areas of action had been achieved.
The aim of updating the areas of action was to concentrate on aspects that can be recorded with targets and measurable performance
indicators (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 24).
Based on these analyses we derived ten areas of action that are of key importance to the future of the Fraport Group. The process of updating
the materiality matrix and the defined areas of action were approved by the Executive Board.

2. Prioritization
Fraport’s management and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, shareholders, analysts, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific bodies, NGOs,
local residents living near airports) confirmed the high relevance of the ten newly defined areas of action for the company’s sustainability in
an online survey. Both groups were also requested to prioritize the issues (see “Materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 24 et seqq.).

3. Validation
After carrying out the stakeholder survey, the results were checked internally and the updated materiality matrix was approved by the
Executive Board. The areas of action of the materiality matrix were then assigned to the relevant GRI G4 Aspects.

are also dedicated to looking after more than 80,000 employees (as of: 2014) at the biggest workplace in Germany. As a large company,
we bear direct, to some extent, as well as indirect social responsibility for these people.

G4-26 Approach to stakeholder engagement
Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with
our stakeholder groups. This includes conducting regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers,
and the continual exchange with local authorities and citizens on subjects relating to the airport (see “Aspect service quality”, page 74
and “2015 Compact”, page 22 et seq.).

G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement
Approach to integration of the interests of the stakeholders:
The materiality matrix helps us to identify and take account of risks and opportunities for the benefit of Fraport, or to avoid impacts as
appropriate. The systematic exchange of information with the most important internal and external stakeholders enables us to develop
perspectives for the strategic alignment of the company. We outline below the opportunities we want to take forward into the future. We
show significant risks in our annual report (see Annual Report 2015, page 74 et seqq.).

In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines, the materiality matrix needed
to be developed in 2015 to focus it even more on the central areas of action for the company’s sustainability. To do this, the content of the
materiality matrix was first reviewed in terms of the requirements of the GRI’s G4 Guidelines and in consideration of benchmark results (see
“Updating the materiality matrix” in the “2015 Compact” report, page 24).
Fraport’s management and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, shareholders, analysts, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific bodies, NGOs,
local residents living near airports) confirmed the relevance of the ten newly defined areas of action for the company’s sustainability in an
online survey. Both groups were also requested to prioritize the issues (see “2015 Compact”, page 27). The surveyed people also had
the opportunity to state further key issues for the future of Fraport AG – but these are covered completely in the defined areas of action.

Resulting key issues:
Our new program was derived from the content of the materiality matrix. This focused on the ten areas of action:
>> Product quality and customer satisfaction
>> Economic efficiency
>> Growth and development in the Group
>> Ideas and innovation
>> Attractive and responsible employer
>> Occupational health and safety
>> Climate protection
>> Conservation of nature and resources
>> Noise abatement
>> Value generation and engagement in the region
A comprehensive summary of all subjects including the associated objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” (see “2015
Compact” report, page 28 et seqq.).

Implementation in communication:
The objectives and measures of the program were passed by the Executive Board at the end of 2015. The program is a key element of the
reporting such that the requirements of the stakeholders are also included in the reporting.

Governance
G4-34 Governance structure
In accordance with German legislation, Fraport is governed by a dual management system: The Executive Board manages the company
with responsibility for sustainable growth in the interests of the company, i.e., taking account of the requirements of the shareholders, its
employees, and the other stakeholder groups associated with the Company. The Executive Board develops the strategic direction of the
company, defines it together with the Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation. The Executive Board is responsible for compliance with the statutory regulations and internal company guidelines, and ensures compliance within the Group. The Executive Board also
ensures appropriate risk management and risk controlling within the Company. The Supervisory Board appoints, monitors, and advises
the Executive Board. Decisions of fundamental importance for the company require the consent of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory
Board has 20 members and has equal shareholder and employee representation. The shareholder representatives are appointed by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The employee representatives are elected by the employees in accordance with the provisions
of the Co-determination Act. The period of office is five years.
More detailed information on the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the composition and work of the committees
is provided in the 2015 Annual Report (see Annual Report 2015, page 17 et seqq.). A list compiled by the Supervisory Board relating to
diversity aspects is provided in the section “Key Figures”, page 24.

Ethics and Integrity
G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior
The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/
corporate-compliance/integrated-management-systems.html) as early as 2002. The Code describes the key principles for the management
and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and responsible corporate
governance (see Fraport AG Corporate Governance Code, Statement on Corporate Management, and Corporate Governance Report).
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of
conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.
In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, transparency, loyalty, and fairness, we
aspire to act with social, economic, and environmental responsibility in our business dealings and see sustainability as designing the future.
The reputation of a company is a key element in our success. We all contribute through our daily work to the positive perception of Fraport.

In order to anchor them more strongly in the company, at the start of 2013 Fraport published two codes of conduct that require employees
and suppliers to comply with these basic principles (see Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG / Code of Conduct for Suppliers
of Fraport AG in the Publications area on www.fraport.com). The Code of Conduct for Employees covers the subjects of compliance,
working conditions, and human rights. Similar to the Code of Conduct for Employees, the Code for suppliers also contains the aspects
of environmental conservation and climate protection. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and
the codes of the Group based on specific topic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html). The Code of Conduct reflects the values culture lived out at Fraport and provides our employees with a
framework for dealing with the economic, legal, and moral challenges of daily business life in a responsible and correct manner.
The Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG was initially introduced at the beginning of 2013 to the German companies of the
Fraport Group and was then gradually rolled out in the majority shareholdings abroad. For each Fraport AG subsidiary, the Group-wide
codes of conduct were introduced as their own code; those in international subsidiaries were also published in their own national language.
Country-specific modifications were permitted.
The acceptance of the codes of conduct is also a key element of the Group Compliance Management System (CMS) guideline rolled out
in 2015 that is to be implemented by the fully consolidated subsidiaries as a minimum requirement. As a result of the publication of both
codes as Fraport AG guidelines at the same time and also the Group guidelines that are binding for the subsidiaries by resolution of their
supervisory bodies, they have been implemented as binding. The training for these issues takes place according to the Fraport AG training
concept and within the subsidiaries under the responsibility of the senior management there. Repeat training on the Code of Conduct
is planned at 3-year intervals. Business partners are not offered compulsory training. All new Group employees receive an appropriate
introduction to the Code of Conduct that is signed along with the employment contract. The Compliance, Risk and Value Management
department is responsible for this binding introduction in the Group, and at local subsidiaries this is the responsibility of the local compliance officer and senior management.
Fraport is engaged at all Group sites in maintaining natural habitats and is striving for preventative environmental management. The environmental policy of Fraport AG was passed and signed in 2008 by the Company’s Executive Board (for further information see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6 in the “Publications” area on www.fraport.com). It is therefore binding for the whole Group. It is based
on a preventative approach for handling natural resources and obliges us to undertake all business activities in an environmentally friendly
way. At each of our majority-owned airports there is an environmental management system that is used to detect and minimize risks. The
long track record of experience enjoyed by Frankfurt Airport in environmental protection provides a tangible benefit for all Group sites, for
example in the form of training courses and technical support, including on-site assistance.
The Group company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” defines the
principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities, the advancement of women into management positions, and diversity for Fraport.
These principles are a key element for decision-making on personnel appointments, training measures, organizational changes, and the
structuring of work time.
Over recent years, the “Agenda 2015” corporate strategy was crucial for Fraport to meet the development needs in aviation and changes
to the environmental conditions. The new mission statement converts Agenda 2015 into a new strategy that will be introduced in the
company in 2016. It takes effect in all areas and is the guideline for future activity. In addition to the corporate purpose, it describes the
objectives, values, and vision (see “Our mission statement” in “2015 Compact”, page 8 et seqq.).
The Group’s mission statement aims to define Fraport's understanding of important issues. Our understanding of management, amongst
other matters, is also described here. With these established aspirations we want to give management activity a common orientation and
obligation and thus make our contribution to achieving the corporate objectives.

Refer to “Our program” in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.

Monitoring and tracking:
Fraport has implemented a Whistleblower System at many of its sites. This is an important tool for identifying or uncovering breaches in
codes. In 2009, Fraport introduced the electronic Whistleblower System BKMS® in the parent company (see https://www.bkms-system.
net/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=6fra1&language=eng). Fraport employees, business partners, and customers have the opportunity
to submit confidential reports about irregularities around the clock using an Internet-based communication platform. This means that information on corruption, economic crime, and infringements of standards of conduct can be notified in confidence throughout the world
at any time. The Whistleblower System was implemented at our Group subsidiary Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD at our Antalya
site in 2010 and in Lima in 2011.
Fraport has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudswoman. She additionally accepts reports on company-related crimes, inadmissible business practices, and serious infringements of regulations. Since 2003, employees at the Frankfurt site have also had an internal
ombudsperson they can turn to.
We have numerous management systems to establish responsible corporate governance in the business processes (http://www.fraport.
com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html). These include environmental, health and safety, and quality
management. To demonstrate the effectiveness and any potential improvement, as early as 1996 we successfully completed certification of
the quality management system to the international ISO 9001 standard. Since 2000, this certification was expanded to Group companies
and investments and a certification association under ISO 9001 was formed. The aim of quality management is to ensure the high quality
and ongoing improvement of all key processes. The awareness of the processes implemented in the company and their effectiveness, efficiency, and interaction are essential for sustainable corporate success. In order to maintain the high level of process quality and, if necessary,
improve it with the relevant responsible person, we conduct internal audits regularly (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/
corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).
Since 1999, Fraport AG has conducted a regular audit at Frankfurt Airport using state authorized and supervised environmental assessors.
The basis for this is the European regulation on the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme” (EMAS). Since 2002, the audit has also applied
the international ISO 14001 standard. These audits under EMAS and ISO 14001 included Fraport Cargo Services GmbH (FCS) in 2008,
N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH (N*ICE) in 2009, and Energy Air GmbH in 2014.
Lima Airport, Ljubljana Airport, and the terminal operation in Antalya have been certified in conformity with ISO 14001. Varna and Burgas
Airports have introduced environmental management systems.
In addition, the airports in Frankfurt, Antalya, and Ljubljana are involved with the Airport Carbon Accreditation of the Airports Council
International (ACI) Europe.

Procedures to monitor sustainable performance:
Since 2014, decision-relevant sustainability issues have been discussed in meetings of the Executive Board including the relevant heads
of the business, service and central units, which increases their binding nature and is accompanied by an increase in significance. These
include passing the materiality matrix and program as well as awarding significant sustainability projects. The Executive Board undertakes
monitoring and control of the issues relevant to sustainability (see “Strategy, objectives, organization” on www.fraport.com).

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level (see “Annual Report 2015”, page 74 et seqq).

Specific Standard Disclosures
Economic Performance Indicators
Management Approach EC
Alongside our function of providing transport, the interest of our owners is safeguarding value and income over the long term, i.e., sustainable
corporate development. We want to continuously increase the assets of Fraport, generate a reasonable return on equity, and generate the
financial means that are necessary for financing future development. Target attainment is measured by various indicators such as value added,
ROFRA (Return on Fraport Assets), revenue, and the result. Fraport plans and controls the development of the Group in accordance with
the principles of value-based management since 2001 with the objective of bringing about a sustainable increase in corporate value. The
key measurement and steering figure of this strategy is the “Fraport value added”, which is calculated as the difference between adjusted
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes including the results before taxes of the associated companies) and the company's capital costs
(Fraport assets x cost of capital) (for further information see Annual Report 2015, page 34 et seqq.).
The highest level in the organization that takes responsibility for the economic performance is the Chief Financial officer (CFO).
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level (see Annual Report 2015, page 75 et seqq).
The following GRI Aspects were defined as material: Economic performance, market presence, and indirect economic impacts (see “Materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 35 et seq.)
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.

G4-EC1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
See Key Figures Finance page 4 et seq.

G4-EC2 Financial implications, risks, and opportunities due to climate change
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Group-wide risk and opportunity management system to identify, control, and limit risks and
detect opportunities. The reference timeframe is the rolling 24-month period. As a result of the longer timeframes for climate change and
the characteristics, the risk and opportunities view is conducted within the environmental management system.
It can currently not be determined that the changes in existing rules initiated by climate change will involve changes to existing business
processes associated with significant costs. Global regulation that could massively affect the predicted growth of global aviation traffic is
rather unlikely as it would be accompanied by restrictions for individual and complete national economies. By 2031, annual global growth
rates of 4.1 % are expected. The expansion measures at Frankfurt Airport and Group airports create sufficient capacity to meet the rising
traffic growth.

Frankfurt Airport is less susceptible to potential restrictions to aviation on shorter routes from national regulations, as it has a high share
of medium and long-distance flights. These cannot be replaced by other means of transport. Compared with short routes, they are more
profitable and have a better environmental balance. Fraport continues to work proactively towards reducing emissions by collecting
emissions-based airport charges as this gives airlines an incentive to use modern aircraft with lower emissions. At Frankfurt Airport, around
two-fifths of goods are transported in passenger aircraft. This advantage is of strategic importance against the background of the debate
on energy efficiency, and it makes a significant contribution to the high profitability of the site.
There are no discernable risks from changes to the physical climate parameters that have a material influence on the company. For Frankfurt
Airport there are meteorological figures for a long period of time and these are recorded on a daily basis. These indicators are analyzed
periodically in order to undertake the necessary changes to the airport infrastructure or existing business processes in good time. The
capacity of drainage and volumes in the rainwater retention basins are checked and taken into account when planning new infrastructure.
Fraport uses a variety of measures to prepare for extreme weather events. One of these is expanding the winter service facilities and their
employees. Potential increases in energy consumption from climate change are countered at an early stage by reducing consumption in
existing buildings using construction and organizational measures. Energy monitoring checks this.
Tighter regulatory requirements due to climate change can also be seen as an opportunity. The development of the energy efficiency
requirements, for example, supports the operational efforts to reduce energy consumption as well as the emissions and costs associated
with this. The standards are met by measures in existing and new buildings. For example, the new head office is certified by DGNB for
reducing life-cycle costs via energy savings and selecting easily reusable materials. Fraport expects increasing requirements for the energy
efficiency of the vehicles and equipment used on a daily basis, so we are gradually converting our fleet.
Physical opportunities exist in the predicted trend of global warming. For example, Fraport could benefit from the expected increase in
average temperatures during the winter months by being able to reduce the cost (resources, personnel, costs) of clearing the site, aprons,
and runways. This could also apply to aircraft de-icing. In addition, this would reduce the energy consumed in the terminals and administration buildings during the winter months and therefore lower CO2 emissions and costs.
Since 2006, Fraport has regularly reported to CDP. Further information: “2015 Compact”, page 58 and https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Results/

Fraport has not received any government grants and subsidies. Fraport AG is a joint-stock company under German law. The shares are listed
on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and are included in the MDAX, the index for mid-sized German joint-stock companies. On account of the
shares held by the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, and the consortium agreement between these two
companies, Fraport AG is a company controlled by these shareholders (see “2015 Compact”, page 17 and Key Figures Finance, page 5).

Material Aspect: Market Presence – Management Approach
The Fraport Group is among the leading global airport groups with its international portfolio. Fraport provides all airport and terminal
operation services and associated services. Fraport also provides planning and consultancy services and has operational and administrative
activities. In addition to the Frankfurt site, at the time of publication of the report Fraport was active at 13 other airports (see “Situation of
the Group”, Annual Report 2015, page 25 et seqq.).

G4-EC5 Ratios of standard entry level wage compared to local minimum wage
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 90 % of the employees in the Group work at this site. There are collective bargaining agreements in 99 % of all Group companies. These exceed the local minimum wage standards. In accordance with the collective
bargaining agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria
such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity.

G4-EC6 Hirings from the local community
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as over 90 % of the employees in the Group work at this site. Fraport has no corporate policy covering the entire organization and does not implement a procedure for preferring local residents in recruitment. In foreign
subsidiary companies, employees from within the country are generally employed on account of the specifics of the business. Only a small
number of managers are seconded from the parent company.

Material Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts – Management Approach
Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to economic and social value creation. Frankfurt Airport, for
example, with more than 80,000 direct employees and around 500 companies, is the largest regional place of work in Germany. Additional
employment effects are also created in enterprises that are appointed by Fraport for the maintenance and expansion of airport infrastructure.
This also benefits around 5.5 million people who live in the metropolitan region around the Airport (see “Value generationand engagement
in the region” in “2015 Compact”, page 50 et seqq.).
In this context, Fraport contributes comprehensively to social value generation. The company’s direct value generation includes expenses
for personnel, capital expenditure, tax, interest, and dividends to its shareholders. Over the past fiscal year, the direct value generation totals
over €2.7 billion (see “Value generation”, page 4 and Annual Report 2015, page 69). The company’s indirect value generation includes
consumption by airport employees and the companies located at the airport who also have their own value chain and employment effects.

G4-EC7 Infrastructure investments and services for public benefit
As an operator of the German airport with the biggest volume of traffic, we have a particular commitment to the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region.
We have a strong track record over many years of contributing to a wide variety of sporting, social, cultural, and environmental activities.
These include donations and sponsorship for numerous clubs, cultural activities, charitable organizations, and educational institutions. For
further information (including on the effects of the support) see “Community” in “2015 Compact”, page 48 et seqq.
You will find an overview of the expenditure for donations, sponsoring, and the Environmental Fund under “G4-EC8 Community engagement”, page 7.
An investigation into the needs of the community in order to establish the specific packages required was not carried out during the
reporting period.
Our employees at international Group sites are also involved.
See also “Voluntary engagement” on www.fraport.com.

G4-EC8 Indirect economic impacts
Frankfurt Airport is an important economic factor for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region. Thanks to its central location and the link with the
airport, this region has been transformed into one of the most sought-after, dynamic and most highly integrated international economic
zones in Europe. A workforce of some 80,000 employees (as at 2014) makes the airport Germany’s biggest workplace.
Around 68 % (€510 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €749 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/
Rhine-Main Region. More than 91 % of all awarded orders were below €10,000 and are therefore to the particular advantage of small and
medium-sized companies. In 2016, orders to companies in the region are expected to remain at a similarly high level. This is complemented
by the economic power of some 500 companies based at the airport. The tax volume generated by the “Airport corporate complex” contributed to financing public services such as schools, sports facilities, hospitals, universities, and social services. See also “2015 Compact”,
page 19 and page 50 et seq. and http://www.fraport.de/de/konzern/flughafen-und-region/wirtschaftsfaktor-flughafen.html.
The airport is also important for the entire Federal Republic of Germany because the German economy is mainly dependent on exports.
Many companies rely on short delivery times and fast turnover of goods in order to be in a position to operate successfully in global markets for sourcing and sales. Aviation is a necessary requirement for this and Frankfurt Airport plays a pivotal role for Germany in this regard.

Relevant Aspect: Procurement
G4-EC9 Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of operations
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation and the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region is defined as local. Around 68 %
(€510 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €749 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main
Region. On account of the legal requirements for the airport operator as a sector contracting entity, it is not possible for Fraport AG to show
preference to companies located in the immediate vicinity or within the wider area when awarding contracts.

The key areas of action are climate protection and the conservation of nature and resources. The following GRI Aspects were defined as
material: Energy, water, biodiversity, emissions, effluents and waste, products and services, transport and noise (see “Materiality matrix” in
“2015 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 35 et seq.
Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS) since 1999. Our airport was the second in Germany to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has been repeated each year. Since 2002, we have also received certification under the international environmental standard
ISO 14001. Environmental management systems exist at all other majority-owned airports. The sites in Antalya, Lima, and Ljubljana are also
certified to ISO 14001 (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).
The key effects were determined using the process of environmental auditing stated in Note I, EMAS REGULATIONS (EU) No. 1221/2009 OF

Relations), see Environmental Statement 2014, Environment policy, page 6, in the Publications section on www.fraport.com.
The environmental key figures for the Fraport parent company are audited and verified in accordance with EMAS via an external environmental
assessor. The assessment of the standards, methods, assumptions, and factors is part of this verification process. The environmental key figures
of the Fraport Group companies are determined using comparable standards and methods. When calculating CO2, country-typical factors
are used or are replaced by factors from the most recent DEFRA set (see http://www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/).

G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption
See G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption, page 10.
Since 2013, Fraport has gradually been introducing CO2/energy consumption controlling at the Frankfurt site. This is a controlling tool for
measuring and managing energy consumption. It creates transparency, helps to reduce energy costs and hence to improve energy efficiency. This tool enables us to monitor whether the strategic CO2 targets are being attained and to identify irregularities an early stage. At
the same time, CO2/energy consumption controlling facilitates the reduction of investment risks and allows successes in implementation
to be communicated within the company and in the public domain. The database is provided by the energy consumption data recorded
in a highly nuanced approach for the parent company on buildings, systems, or equipment. All energy sources, such as electricity, district
cooling, district heating, gas, and fuel for vehicles and combustion are taken into account. Planning and construction based on life-cycle
cost is implemented when portfolio buildings are refurbished and energy efficiency is enhanced. This is also the case for new buildings.
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers, also called intermodality, has a long track record at Fraport extending back to the
1970s. For example, in 2015, 30 % of all passengers used the train (ICE, long-distance and regional trains, or metropolitan railway) to travel
to and from the airport. If other public transport and buses are included, the share was 35.4 %. At Fraport AG and in the Group it was even
just under 40 %. Fraport is working together with German Rail (DB) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG to maintain and improve the use of public
transport by passengers, with measures such as integrated travel packages and the inclusion of air traffic in the network planning of German
Rail. Fraport employees are motivated to use public transport by the offer of a free job ticket. In 2015, over 30 % of employees used local
public transport (metropolitan railway, regional railway, and bus). Journeys by passengers and employees to and from the airport are not the
only trips to “go by rail”. Plans are also being made to transfer cargo from road to rail.
We are also optimizing the air freight logistics chain at Cargo City from environmental and commercial perspectives. In recent years, we have
created or initiated various projects such as founding the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt e. V. and introducing the IT platform Fair@Link
(project developer: Dakosy AG, Hamburg). This is the basis on which we define and establish the rules of cooperation that should lead to
the freight up and downline being more coordinated and therefore running more smoothly than is currently the case and avoiding backlogs.

Material Aspect: Biodiversity – Management Approach
Our business activities and natural biodiversity can be harmonized. Areas that are close to nature and their inherent biodiversity are preserved
and supported as far as this is possible within the operational constraints. Any impairments are kept as restricted as possible. Where substantial
impacts occur, at least equal mitigation or equivalent replacement is carried out and we ensure long-term preservation of function. Fraport
has made a commitment to long-term preservation of biodiversity at Frankfurt airport and has also decided to support projects beyond the
confines of the Airport relating to the preservation of biological diversity in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region and in Hesse through its Environmental Fund. The orchard meadows in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region are particularly worthy of protection. Orchard meadows in the State
of Hesse have been reduced by around 90 % over the past 30 years. The meadows have a high level of species diversity and therefore play an
important role in retaining regional biodiversity. The Hesse Society for Ornithology and Nature Conservation (HGON) (http://www.hgon.de/
vor-ort/hgon-vor-ort/unsere-arbeitskreise/frankfurt-am-main/) in Frankfurt uses the financial support from Fraport to preserve valuable biotopes.
Our “principles for biodiversity” presented here (in the environmental policy of Fraport AG and in “Protect environment – maintain biodiversity” in the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com) describe our responsibility for this important range of subjects, and document
biodiversity projects at the airport and in the region that we conduct ourselves or support financially. International agreements for the
protection of biodiversity, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), European directives, such as the Habitats Directive and
the Birds Directive, and national legislation such as the Federal Nature Conservation Act, are important foundations in conjunction with the
actions taken in our valuable areas of nature.
More information can be found in our principles for biodiversity (see “Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity” in the “Publications”
section on www.fraport.com).
The activities of Fraport AG and its subsidiaries do not generally entail any hazards for endangered species of plants or animals. Hazards of
this nature only occur when the operational areas are expanded. In the European Union, an Environment Impact Assessment has to be carried
out when this occurs and appropriate mitigation or replacement measures have to be implemented.
Species on Germany’s Red List of endangered species exist at Frankfurt Airport. Plants and animals which are endangered at other locations
have settled on the areas between the takeoff and landing runways or the taxiways due to the usage pattern. These areas of land in the
operating areas very seldom experience human activity, and the kind of visitor pressure seen in nature conservation areas accessible to the
general public does not occur here.

GRI Report 2015

The Group airports outside of Germany are generally financed through international banks. An Environmental Management Plan has to be
submitted which is generally based on an Environmental Impact Assessment and defines how the consequences of intervention can be
minimized. No species on the relevant Red Lists of endangered species are registered by the Group airports.
Fraport has a “Wildlife Management” system. Collisions with individual birds or, in particular, flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because
around 70 % of all bird strikes take place at airports or neighboring areas, as an airport operator Fraport is also obliged to minimize this risk.
In contrast to many international airports, in Frankfurt we focus on special biotope management. This concerns making the airport area
unattractive to relevant birds, i.e., minimizing or avoiding nesting­, resting, and feeding opportunities. The bird strike rate based on verified
notifications from pilots over the past 13 years in Frankfurt was between 2 and a maximum of 3.5 cases per 10,000 aircraft movements.
Within the airport site, the areas between the two newly constructed aprons and the new runway were developed as nutrient-poor grassland
(approx. 85 ha) and dwarf shrub heathland (approx. 132 ha). To achieve this, local seeds were collected on the airport site and the nearby
area and planted on these areas. In addition, the implementation of the sandy grassland and sandy meadows from the former Kelsterbach
substation to free areas in Kelsterbach Wood (approx. 2 ha) was successful and the biotopes with the protected maiden pinks and dwarf
everlasting flowers are also developing positively.

G4-EN11 Sites in, or adjacent to, protected areas
A total area of owned land amounting to 22.84 km² and an operational area of 18.60 km² within that area means that, based on area, our
airport in Frankfurt/Main is one of the most compact major airports in the world. By making optimum use of our operational area, we contribute to keeping the utilization of natural areas in the densely populated Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region as low as possible. Unoccupied areas
at the airport are landscaped wherever possible. Environmentally valuable areas are located in the areas bordering takeoff runway 18 (west)
with species-rich extensive meadowland, nutrient-poor grassland, sandy grassland adapted to dry habitats, and calluna (heather) heathland.
The areas between the south and center runways measure approximately 600 ha and they are arguably the biggest area of green space in the
region which is not used for agriculture. Apart from a substantial proportion of land of “minor biological value” (primarily sealed under road
surfaces), the airport has large areas of land which are used by animals and plants as habitats. Smaller species of birds, such as wheatears,
European stonechats, or whinchats, can be regularly found there, and in spring natterjack toads and populations of frogs can also be seen.
The precise details are found at G4-EN11 Sites in, or adjacent to, protected areas, page 11.
See also “Conservation of nature and resources” in “2015 Compact”, page 60 et seq.
See also “Conservation of nature and resources” and “Environmental Fund” on www.fraport.com.

G4-EN12 Impacts on biodiversity
The environmental impact audit at Frankfurt Airport verified that overall no sustainable negative impacts were caused to directly adjacent
conservation areas. This has been verified since 2010 during the course of monitoring biotopes and species (see “List of areas with measures”
in the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com).

G4-EN13 Habitats protected or restored
When construction work is carried out at the airport, the objective is to have minimum impact on the natural environment and the landscape.
However, if areas of land have to be developed, mitigation measures are necessary. That said, the extensive and comprehensive environmental measures achieve more than simple compensation (see “List of areas with measures” in the Publications section on www.fraport.
com). Regular monitoring of fauna and flora is a constituent element of the plan approval notice and is outsourced to an external agency.
Additional information (for example on restoration measures) can be found in the “Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity” document

Material Aspects: Emissions, Effluents, and Waste – Management Approach
Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS) since 1999. Our Group majority-owned airports have established environmental management systems that systematically record
emissions, effluents, and waste. In Antalya, Lima, and Ljubljana the management systems are also certified to ISO 14001 (see Management
Approach EN, page 44).
In 2008, Fraport already summarized all activities directed toward climate protection in a single project that focused on three fields: energy-saving measures in the existing portfolio of buildings and infrastructure, efficient energy use in new buildings, and reduction of energy
consumption in the Company’s own vehicle fleet. Comprehensive CO2/energy consumption controlling is used to check all measures directed
toward climate protection. Fraport AG has received international recognition for its climate protection activities: In 2015, the airport operator
again achieved the third out of four certification levels of Airport Carbon Accreditation awarded by ACI Europe, the umbrella organization
for airport operators. Since 2006, Fraport has been contributing its climate reporting to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP), the world’s
leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. In Climate Disclosure Scoring, Fraport improved over the previous year by three
points to 98 out of 100 points.
The air pollutants and emissions are calculated or, since 2002, continuously measured at two dedicated stations. Measures for reduction
are implemented: Collection of emissions-dependent airport charges based on nitrous gases and hydrocarbons, use of alternative drive
technologies by introducing electrically driven ground handling devices. In addition, methods of calculating air pollutant emissions from
infrastructure and aircraft handling were also developed.
At the Fraport parent company, the rain water falling in winter is contaminated with biologically degradable de-icing agents for the aircraft
and airfield surfaces when snow falls or frost occurs. Rain water with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 200 mg of oxygen per liter is
retained and treated in water-treatment plants.
The principle of Fraport’s waste management is to recycle or reuse unavoidable waste as far as possible. Frankfurt Airport separates non-hazardous waste including paper, glass, packaging waste (DSD green-dot waste), and residual waste. The collected waste is either fed into
advanced sorting systems where any contaminants are separated out, and the recyclable materials are then conveyed to the recycling plant
or the recently modernized waste to energy plant operated by the City of Frankfurt. The steam generated here by combustion is used for
the production of electricity and district heating. The hazardous waste created at Fraport is also collected separately and channeled away for
recycling as far as possible. Where there is no recycling option, the waste is thermally processed in a special combustion system or disposed
of in a physicochemical treatment facility.
For further information on reductions of emissions, effluents, and waste, see “2015 Compact”, page 60 et seq.
The air pollutant emissions are recorded in the “Environmental Impact, Noise and Air Quality” team of the strategic business unit Airside and
Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security. The CO2 emissions are surveyed and monitored in the Environmental Management
department. Environmental Management is located in the central unit Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability, whereas
the operational management of effluents is in the Integrated Facility Management service unit. At the Fraport parent company, a dedicated
Waste Disposal department carries out this management function.
For further information, see Environmental Statement 2014, Organizational chart page 4, Air pollutants page 27 – 29, Effluents page 37 – 38,
Waste page 46 – 47 (see the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com).

G4-EN17 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3)
See G4-EN17 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3), page 12.
Air traffic in the landing and takeoff cycle up to an altitude of 3,000 ft generates the greatest emissions (around 952 thousand metric tons
of CO2). This is followed by the transport of originating passengers to and from the airport (around 201 thousand metric tons of CO2), the
energy consumption by infrastructure and vehicles operated by third parties at the site (approximately 181 thousand metric tons), Fraport
AG and third party employee transport to the airport at 113 thousand metric tons of CO2, and by the business journeys carried out by staff
members at Fraport AG (approximately 0.7 thousand metric tons of CO2). The airport charges based on NOx emissions also have an indirect
impact on the emissions of air traffic. The unique intermodal link to the local metropolitan rail network and the national long-distance transport
by regional and long-distance trains means that passengers can be conveniently transferred from private transport and short-haul flights to
rail travel. Energy marketing by a Fraport subsidiary and selective stakeholder engagement have an impact on the CO2 emissions of third
parties. Business trips are essentially necessary through air travel to our investments.
As part of the participation in the ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation, CO2 emissions for Scope 3 were also determined at Antalya and Ljubljana
airports. Further information can be found in the Environmental Statement 2014, Environmental Aspect climate gases, page 15 et seqq. (see
“Publications” area on www.fraport.com).
Relevant information for the other Group sites cannot currently be collected as this is very complex for an airport.

G4-EN19 Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
Climate protection is one of the most important challenges for the air-traffic industry. As an airport operator, we support the four-pillar strategy
of the air-traffic industry with measures for climate protection in air traffic. In this context, we focus our efforts on areas which we are able
to directly influence. These essentially relate to technical improvements in buildings and installations, process optimizations and economic
tools such as airport charges relating to noise and emissions (see “2015 Compact”, page 58 et seq.).
Furthermore, Fraport supports a number of industry-wide initiatives which are directed at reducing CO2 emissions. Fraport is involved in SESAR
(Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research), an initiative by the European Commission and EUROCONTROL, which is intended
to secure the future viability of European air traffic management with the involvement of all the players involved in air traffic. The various
action plans within the scope of this initiative include integrated planning of flights, i.e., all the players involved are working to optimize the
process from undocking the aircraft to reaching the target destination. This means that airports also become important players in air traffic
management. The advantages for passengers and the environment are shorter flight times and reduced emissions. The targets of SESAR to
2020 comprise increasing capacities threefold since 2005, reducing environmental impact per flight by 10 %, increasing safety tenfold, and
reducing air safety costs by half (http://www.sesarju.eu/).

As a member of the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) through ACI, the global association of companies involved in air traffic, Fraport supports
their targets: Reduction of CO2 by 1.5 % per year by 2020 and carbon-neutral growth by 2050. This means a reduction in CO2 emissions in
2050 by 50 % compared with 2005 throughout the whole industry (http://www.atag.org/). In 2010, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) passed a resolution for an improvement in fuel efficiency of 2 % per year for the airlines until 2050. A further resolution was
also passed with the objective of carbon-neutral growth from 2020.
Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI, with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European
airports to adopt CO₂-neutral operation. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be audited in accordance with the rules of Airport Carbon
Accreditation and it was accepted into the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. Fraport has reached
Level 3 “Optimization”. Stakeholder engagement is a key element of this stage. Our investment, Antalya Airport, has also reached Level 3+
“Neutrality”. In 2015, Ljubljana Airport achieved Level 2 “Reduction” by appropriate measures.
Fraport also contributes its climate reporting externally to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP) (www.cdp.net), the world’s leading climate
reporting initiative in the financial industry. This index analyzes companies and their strategies on climate change and CO2 reporting. Since
2006, Fraport has been involved in CDP and has improved its Climate Disclosure Scoring by three points compared with the previous year
to 98 out of 100 points. See also G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption, page 52.

G4-EN21 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions
Fraport AG emits approximately the following amounts each year
NOX: 264 metric tons
Benzene: 0.4 metric tons
PM10: 9.3 metric tons
These data are derived from the zoning plan documents. Determining the data was extremely complex and expensive so that this procedure
has not been repeated again. In future, the data are to be subject to continuous reporting and the necessary processes are currently being
put in place. We are unable to influence other air emissions with our measures and they are therefore not significant.
As the data collection for vehicle and other emissions from handling processes at an airport are very complex and therefore costly, these are
not conducted for the Group airports.

Material Aspect: Products and Services – Management Approach
Our commitment to environmental protection and environmental compatibility is directed toward maintaining our natural habitats.
The focus of our actions is provided by measures to avoid, reduce, and mitigate environmental impacts that arise or could arise as a result
of airport operations. Our environmental management focuses on the areas of noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity. As
part of our program, we have set the strategic goals (see “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.) and track these with various measures and
projects, e.g., for climate protection (see report “2015 Compact”, page 58 et seqq. and our website www.fraport.com > Climate protection), on maintaining and supporting biodiversity (“Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity”) and as part of our global environmental
management (see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6, in the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com. We are also continuing our
efforts on noise abatement.
See also Management Approach EN, page 44.

G4-EN27 Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts
Since the end of 2013, there has been a returns system for bottles and cans with refundable deposit in both terminals at Frankfurt Airport.
Following a successful test run, a total of 25 returnables machines came on stream. The amount for the deposit is donated to four charitable
institutions. The guest decides for themselves which organization benefits from the donation.
Our environmental management focuses on the areas of noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity.

Material Aspect: Transport – Management Approach
Networking with other transport providers – called intermodality – generates additional traffic volumes in competition with other airports: The
link to the high-speed rail network increases the catchment area of Frankfurt Airport compared with airports without a long-distance railway
station. It enhances the hub function, increases passenger numbers, and generates important competitive advantages for us. At the same
time, the transfer from flight to rail traffic facilitates partial easing of capacity for air traffic. This means that slots (time windows for takeoffs and
landings) of short-haul flights that have been transferred to rail can be released for urgently needed European and intercontinental flights.
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers, also called intermodality, has a long track record at Fraport extending back to the
1970s. At that time, the first underground station at a German airport was opened under the newly constructed Terminal 1 – today this is the
airport regional station. When the AIRail Terminal was opened in 1999, the link was created to the national and international long-distance
rail network. ICE traffic as a percentage of total traffic for arriving and departing passengers rose from 3 % in 1999 to 14.5 % in 2015. In
2015, 30 % of arriving and departing originating passengers used the railway to and from the airport (metropolitan railway, regional trains,
regional express, ICE, IC, long-distance trains). If buses are included, the share was 35.4 % in 2015, whereas this was only 23.6 % in 1999.
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses.
Indicators on intermodality are included under the transport aspect, page 15.

G4-EN30 Significant environmental impacts of transport and traffic
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers – also known as intermodality – has a long track record back to the 1970s with Fraport
(see Environmental Statement 2014, Environmental Aspect transport, page 24 et seqq. in the “Publications” section on www.fraport.com).
A list of indicators is provided under “G4-EN30 Significant environmental impacts of transport and traffic”, page 15.
The CO2 emissions caused by traffic on the airport complex are reported for the Fraport parent company and the Group under “G4-EN15
Direct greenhouse gas emissions”, page 12 and “G4-EN16 Energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions”, page 12. The emissions of air pollutants
are found under “G4-EN21 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions”, page 50.

Aspect: Intermodality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Information on intermodality was reported under the previous aspect “Transport”. Fraport is working to make the airport accessible to as
many passengers and employees as possible with public transport by networking with other carriers – also known as intermodality.– We are
working very closely with other carriers to achieve this objective. For example, in 2015, 30 % of all originating passengers used the train to
travel to and from the airport. If buses are also included, the share was 35.4 %. The challenge is to maintain this figure despite the growing
volume of passengers. Fraport employees are motivated to use public transport with a free job ticket. In 2015, around 30 % of employees
used local public transport (metropolitan and regional rail and public buses).
We are also optimizing the air freight logistics chain at Cargo City from environmental and commercial perspectives. Making traffic flow in
and around the airport efficient whilst having the lowest possible impact on the environment requires increasing coordination of the processes with all participants – cargo lines, freight forwarders, handling agents, customs etc.– Fraport has also launched a pilot project with a
number of partners directed toward developing an IT-based Cargo Community System. In 2011, the transport flows were analyzed with a
view to potential for optimization, and the pilot project with full routine, everyday operation was started up at the beginning of 2012 (see
Environmental Statement 2011, page 23 et seqq., “Publications” section on www.fraport.com).
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses. In the whole Group the
share is 39 % (2015).

Aspect: Noise (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Fraport has already taken responsibility for introducing noise-related landing and takeoff charges at Frankfurt Airport in 1993. Up to the year
2000, noise differentiation was based on the noise values in the noise authorization documents provided with aircraft. In 2001, the noise
differentiation was converted to type-specific noise values determined by the aircraft noise measurement system operating at Frankfurt
Airport. Since then, the differentiation and the range of charges has been gradually increased. Since January 2013, the aircraft types have
been divided into 16 noise categories and these categories have been managed separately for landing and takeoff. The spread of noise classes
is particularly noticeable at night because night movements must pay a night surcharge. This is even higher during the core night period
(11 p.m. – 4.59 a.m.) than during marginal nighttime periods (10 p.m. – 10.59 p.m. and 5 a.m. – 5.59 a.m.). Night surcharges are intended
to create an economic incentive for the deployment of quieter aircraft and to transfer aircraft movements from the night-time period to the
day. According to the currently applicable charging rules for Frankfurt Airport, on average 3.2 % higher takeoff and landing charges must be
paid than under the previous rules. The spread between loud and quiet was strengthened so that particularly loud aircraft are charged more
than average. Here, the charges were increased by 8 % whereas for the quietest aircraft they only increased by 2.7 %.
Even before the new Runway Northwest came into operation, flight procedures for reducing noise were being developed and tested. Since
founding the Airport and Region Forum (FFR), a committee of experts located there with representatives from local communities, airlines, air
traffic control, the airport (Fraport AG), politics, and science have been the driving force for these active noise abatement activities.
The action plan comprised seven measures for reducing noise. These were expanded by a package of 19 measures signed on February 29,
2012 and entitled “Together for the Region – Alliance for more Noise Abatement 2012” (see “Noise abatement” on www.fraport.com).
Within the continuing collaboration in the “Active Noise Abatement” expert committee, Fraport has taken on the leadership for the design
and implementation of some of these measures. One of these measures is raising the approach angle for Runway Northwest by 0.2 degrees.
This measure enlarges the overflight height above urban areas from the distance at which the beam on the instrument loading system during
horizontal intermediate approach is normally reached. For the currently applicable intermediate approach height of 5,000 feet for Runway
Northwest, this results in a greater flight height at a distance of around 27 km compared with the 3.0 degree approach.
Fraport AG has equipped Runway Northwest with two instrument landing systems (ILS) per operating direction for the approach angles
of 3.0 and 3.2 degrees. On approaches with a tailwind or poor weather conditions, the previous angle of 3.0 degrees should initially be
retained for safety reasons. The test operations conducted since October 2012 showed that when using the 3.2 degree approach there was
neither an increased number of go-arounds nor delays to arriving aircraft. Analyses from the German Center for Aviation and Space Travel
(DLR) at a total of seven noise measurements stations of Fraport AG and by the Environment and Neighborhood House (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus (UNH)) showed a reduction in the maximum noise level for over-flights of 0.5 – 1.5 dB (A) depending on the location of the
measuring station and the aircraft type. The Federal Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) has now approved permanent
normal operation on Runway Northwest.
The usage rate of the 3.2 degree approach on Runway Northwest is around 70 %, meaning it is higher for operating direction 07 than for
operating direction 25 due to the combination of weather conditions and operating direction. The capital expenditure for the additional
ILS systems was €3.2 million.
In future, steeper approaches should also be possible on the “old” runways of our airport. However, this cannot be achieved in the same way
as for Runway Northwest because there is not enough space to set up the ILS systems here. Instead, we are using a completely new technology
in the form of GBAS. The abbreviation stands for ‘ground-based augmentation system’, a type of technology that facilitates satellite-based
precision approaches. Our airport, the first international hub in Europe, has implemented the new approach system. A significant advantage
of the system is that only one ground station is required for a wide variety of approaches on all runways and in both operating directions.
However, for the system to be used to its full extent, technical equipment is required on airplanes as well as on the ground. In particular, the
Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8, 787, and 737 NG currently have the relevant equipment. Following an extensive system test in cooperation with
the operators of these aircraft models, we would like to offer GBAS-supported approaches at 3.2 degrees on all runways from spring 2017.
We have invested some €2.5 million to construct and put the GBAS ground station into operation.
Further examples of active noise abatement measures that are currently being developed or tested include continuous climb operations
(CCO) and the development of even steeper approaches.

We are also focusing on abolishing aircraft noise at ground level. For example, reverse thrust with higher load levels, depending on dispersion
characteristics, produces noticeable noise in nearby residential areas. Reverse thrust may thus only be used at Frankfurt Airport for safety
reasons. By means of an automated monitoring program, we intend to systematically analyze the use of reverse thrust with higher load levels
in order to detect and prevent improper use. Fraport is the first airport worldwide to develop a detection system for this which is based on
the coupled use of microphone systems. Active noise abatement is supplemented by passive noise abatement measures. On the basis of
the German Aircraft Noise Act, the Hesse State Government enacted a Noise Abatement Zone Directive for Frankfurt Airport. This defines
noise protection areas. Furthermore, a comprehensive regional fund totaling some €265 million was set up to finance additional benefits
providing private households and eligible public institutions with passive noise abatement measures. Funds are also being provided from
the Regional Fund so that claims for passive noise abatement can be brought forward. This measure enables those entitled to reimbursement
to submit their claims before 2016 (statutory date for claims). The budget is provided by the State of Hesse and by Fraport. The entitlement
to compensation for damage caused by aircraft noise to the exterior of houses and buildings requiring special protection is now regulated
following the entry into force of the third regulation for the execution of the German Aircraft Noise Act (3. FlugLSV) in August 2013. An
entitlement arises for properties that are within day protection zone 1 of the Airport.
We have been measuring aircraft noise around the airport for more than 50 years. Fraport currently maintains 29 measuring stations and
three mobile measuring stations. We publish the results of aircraft noise measurements and other information relating to flight operations,
such as route allocations or the use of directions in the takeoff and landing runway system, online at www.fraport.com. The measurement
results also form the basis for the calculation of noise-related takeoff and landing charges.
The new FRA Map application allows internet users to create an individual image of their own aircraft noise situation on the basis of calculated aircraft noise values. The interactive map gives access to information on diverse topics and focuses specifically on the people affected
as they can enter their home address. The “Aircraft Noise Information” function presents data related to aircraft noise in a compact form for
the entered address.
In January 2016, Fraport published the most recent noise abatement report on the previous summer traffic scheduling period (2015). This
report provides information twice a year on the development of aircraft noise pollution in the region and presents progress made in terms
of noise abatement at Frankfurt Airport. The number of aircraft movements was 1.4 % higher in the past summer traffic scheduling period
(2015) than in the same period in the previous year. However, continuous noise levels at most Fraport aircraft noise measurement points
have not changed. Decreases in continuous noise levels were even recorded during the day at some measuring stations in the east and
west. The decline in eastern operations from 34.8 % in summer 2014 to 31.9 % in summer 2015 particularly justifies the decline in continuous noise levels at the approach measuring stations in the west. Lower continuous noise levels were measured in 2015 than in 2014 at
the measuring stations 01 Offenbach-Bieber and 02 Offenbach-Lauterborn in the east, even though the number of approaches over these
measuring stations increased. An active noise abatement measure that has been implemented on the Airbus A319, A320, and A321 operated
by Lufthansa is responsible for this. The measure to reduce noise emissions created by aircraft consists of mounting a kind of wind deflector,
known as a vortex generator, over vents on the underside of wings. These generators prevent an even flow over the openings and thus
the development of noise caused by air flowing over aircraft. As Lufthansa carries out almost 40 % of all movements in Frankfurt during the
day using the A320 family, this measure is particularly effective at reducing noise in the daytime. The current level of noise is lower than the
values forecast for the expansion.
Fraport AG supported the NORAH Noise Impact Study (“Noise-Related Annoyance, Cognition, and Health”), which was initiated by the
Environmental and Neighborhood Organization (UNH), carried out over a period of five years and completed in October 2015.
It was the aim of the NORAH study to obtain a comprehensive and scientifically substantiated description, insofar as possible, of the effects of
noise caused by air, rail, and road transport on the health and quality of life of the relevant resident population. The scientifically valid results
that have now been presented contain remarkable new findings in comparison with earlier scientific assumptions.

GRI Report 2015

GRI Content Index / Environmental Performance Indicators

55

Based on the results of the various study modules on the issue, it can be said that the health risks caused by aircraft noise are minimal and
thus lower than they were previously assumed to be. For example, the initial assumption underlying the study of a connection between
aircraft noise and damage to health due to an increase in blood pressure could not be confirmed. Moreover, no significant connection was
found for the entire group between stress from aircraft noise and the risk of a heart attack or stroke. The health of residents living close to the
airport is thus not significantly detrimentally affected by air traffic. Compared to other modes of transport and also in comparison to earlier
studies, the NORAH study found the lowest level of risk increases due to aircraft noise. These risk increases, contrary to earlier assumptions,
were also insignificant for the most part.
These new results, which differ from previous studies, are particularly assured due to the high scientific standards of the study, which included
extensive quality controls.

AO7 Change of people residing in areas affected by noise
See AO7 Change of people residing in areas affected by noise, page 16.
There are no statutory regulations at other Group sites and no calculation parameters for determining the number and percentage of residents
living near the airport who are affected by aircraft noise.

Labor Practices and Decent Work
Management Approach LA
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. In 2013,
Fraport published two in-house codes of conduct to establish more firmly these principles within the Company. These two codes commit
employees and suppliers to comply with these fundamental principles. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific topic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/
compliance-values-management.html).
The following GRI Aspects were defined as material: Employment, Labor/management relations, Occupational health and safety, Training
and education, Diversity and equal opportunity, Equal remuneration for women and men (see “Materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”,
page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 35).
We continuously develop our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical safety
of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility play an important role here. This is why Fraport
carries out regular training on occupational safety. Employees working on the apron continued to receive training sessions, which began
in 2013, with practical tips on safe driving to avoid specific accident risks. Lightning protection seminars were further events offered to
this group of employees. These allowed employees to learn about electrostatic discharges, dangers posed by thunderstorms, and corresponding protective measures. The Annual Meeting for Safety Officers in 2015 focused on the issue of “traffic safety”. Apprentices in their
first year at Fraport AG received information about occupational health and safety on a safety day. Focal points included ergonomics and
proper lifting and carrying.
Objectives and measures can be found in the program in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Employment – Management Approach
Fraport is one of the biggest employers in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. In addition to the Frankfurt site, Fraport AG also operates 13
airports on four continents in the form of majority and minority shareholdings, as well as under management contracts (see “Annual Report
2015”, page 25). As a company operating on the global stage, we are committed to the values and standards of behavior enshrined in the
principles of the UN Global Compact, the ILO core labor standards, and the OECD principles for multinational companies. We developed a
Code of Conduct in 2012 with the aim of making the associated obligations even more transparent. This code is binding for all employees
of Fraport AG. At the beginning of 2013, it came into force in the parent company and is gradually being introduced throughout the Group.
Fraport has no guiding principles and programs relating to recruitment of local personnel by airport operators and contractors, measures for
reducing the number of employees with access to the security areas of the airport, and measures which demand the loyalty of employees
to the immediate contractor.

G4-LA2 Benefits provided to full-time employees
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation. Fraport generated more than 80 % of its revenue at the Frankfurt site in 2015.
Fraport offers employees a series of non-payscale benefits (see http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/rewards---benefits.
html). Supplementary company social benefits are granted equally to all employees (as appropriate, pro rata in accordance with the scope
of employment). This also applies – unless a specified period of service with the Company is a prerequisite for entitlement – regardless of
whether the employment is
Our material, controlled airport investments also provide non-payscale benefits. For example, Fraport Twin Star offers its employees –
regardless of their period of employment, but prorated according to their scope of employment as appropriate – additional social benefits
(additional salary components for pension schemes, food, etc.), health promotion (participation in health measures, payscale supplementary
health insurance, etc.), but also measures such as company sports, training opportunities, and the provision of public transport.
Our Peruvian investment Lima Airport Partners follows suit. Employees receive – regardless of their type of employment – a salary above the
national level; there is also an extensive program (“Club LAP”) of optional supplementary benefits. This program includes six categories,
covering the areas of the work-life balance, family, health, free time, and financial well-being of employees. Benefits such as increased cover
for health and life insurance, company bus transport, opportunities to take part in fitness and sporting activities, and additional days off to
promote a work-life balance are examples of what the program offers.
Aerodrom Ljubljana also offers its employees various additional benefits. These include the acquisition of and contribution to supplementary
insurance (pension scheme, accident insurance), the granting of time quotas and flexible working hours, social support for family events,
and health promotion in the form of preventative measures and company sports. All these benefits are granted regardless of the period
of employment.

Material Aspect: Labor/Management Relations – Management Approach
Fraport has a long tradition as a company with a social perspective and a partner-centered approach. Our aim is not simply to be a big employer in quantitative terms. We also want to be just and fair by rewarding our employees for their performance and commitment. This involves
giving them fair wages and salaries, and a package of benefits that goes beyond pay. We offer a high level of job security, good working
conditions based on collective bargaining agreements, career and personal development options, and a highly developed corporate ethic.
The operations of Fraport AG and its subsidiary companies are primarily carried out by the companies’ own employees. 99 % of these are
employed and paid under collective agreements. The risk of strikes that could lead to disruption of the operation of the airport is therefore
extremely low. This also includes all areas relevant to security, such as security check points, airport security, and operational safety. We are
unable to exert any influence on other contractual partners or on the customers of our airports in relation to work satisfaction.

G4-LA4 Minimum notice periods regarding significant operational changes
Fraport works closely with employee representatives in an atmosphere of trust. Pursuant to the Works Constitution Act, the Works Council
must be promptly and comprehensively informed about any changes in the business. This has not been defined in detail or restricted within
the framework of the collective agreements. A notification obligation of three months is standard business practice.
A total of 41 meetings and three extraordinary meetings during the course of the year of the Works Council were held at the parent company
in 2015, while the Group Works Council came together for ten ordinary meetings . Just as in Frankfurt, Fraport also ensures that employees
have the basic right of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining negotiations at international sites where Fraport has a
majority shareholding. We are committed to open cooperation in an atmosphere of trust with democratically elected employee representatives, and we use this process to work toward achieving a settlement that is fair for all interests.

Material Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety – Management Approach
Fraport aims to look after the physical, emotional, and psychosocial well-being of its employees through a range of comprehensive measures
directed at promoting preventive health and safety over the long term. Another responsibility for Fraport relates to developing holistic
preventative concepts that are tailored to the specific needs of an aging workforce in general and the preservation of workers’ employability
in operational areas in particular through longer working lives.
Fraport AG responds to all health and safety risks in relation to prevention activities within the framework of behavioral and situational
prevention.
Minimizing noise is defined by Fraport as significant for all employees at Frankfurt Airport. Various noise events are recorded and time-weighted
in order to assess the noise exposure of employees. Apart from background noise, which is especially present during continuous handling at
the airport, noise is mainly analyzed where it directly impacts on members of staff when they are carrying out their work. These individual
“modules” can then be used to calculate individual stress profiles for workplaces as well as for individual employees. This evaluation thus
identifies the extent to which measures are required to reduce noise pollution. The T-O-P hierarchy of measures is used to implement the
measures. This means that the application of technical and organizational measures takes precedence over personnel measures.
Moreover, prevention work focused on reducing work that puts stress on the musculoskeletal system. The use of innovative technologies
should improve jobs in this respect. The vacuum lifting aid system was successfully rolled out and other technologies have been reviewed
in terms of their usability.
Handling of hazardous substances by our employees – and by employees of third-party companies – is carried out in accordance with the
Hazardous Substances Directive in particular. In conformity with new regulations of the Hazardous Substances Directive and the Technical
Regulations for Hazardous Substances (TRGS), the previous hazard analyses (hazardous substance datasheets) have been revised and
adjusted to meet the statutory regulations. All hazardous substances go through product assessments which look at potential fields of
application in detail.
Building sites continue to harbor the risk of accidents. For this reason, occupational safety measures still require the full attention of the
principal and the executing company. The Occupational Health and Safety unit provides advice for all construction projects throughout
the entire period of the project. The basis of the advice is the generally binding German Construction Site Health and Safety Regulations
(Baustellenverordnung). The occupational health and safety coordinators in the unit monitor compliance with these regulations.
Employees in the Occupational Health and Safety unit provided a range of advisory services in 2015. In addition to supporting many
smaller and medium-sized building projects, the focus was on supporting the construction of Terminal 3. Finding organizations to execute
maintenance and repair work particularly took a great deal of time, due to the size of the project.
Safety measures are agreed where Fraport works together with external companies. Causes of accidents are jointly analyzed and investigated, and opportunities are explored to prevent and avoid accidents. The company has established effective processes for this in the past.

GRI Report 2015

Accident trends show that we are making progress thanks to our work. For this reason, the work we started was continued successfully in 2015.
On the apron, we operate a large number of vehicles for transporting freight and people. The focus is therefore on the area of “internal
transport and traffic”. The driving safety of our personnel is therefore a top priority here in order to maintain the safety of all road users on the
airport site. Fraport therefore regularly carries out driving training courses as well as “refresher” courses for drivers who have infringed traffic
rules. We have clear evidence that this approach has succeeded in reducing the number of accidents causing damage within the company.
The pandemic plan/plan for protection against infectious diseases of Fraport AG regulates the measures which Fraport AG takes at the
Frankfurt Airport site in accordance with the German Protection against Infections Act if highly infectious diseases occur. The main targets
are securing safe operation of the airport in conformity with standard operating procedures and protection of customers and employees.
The responsibility assumed by Fraport for occupational health and safety is also clearly defined with regard to temporary staff. They have
an equal priority alongside permanent employees when it comes to occupational health and safety, and they go through a professional
induction phase at Fraport.
Creating positive conditions for the health of employees at Frankfurt Airport is the clear mandate of all company staff working in health and
safety.– This is coordinated and planned by Fraport Health Management. Innovative concepts and tools (see “Health Management Measures” on www.fraport.com in the “Publications” area) aim to limit or reverse the illness rate, which is increasing overall for various reasons.
The offerings are available to employees of Fraport AG, and some are available to their families.
We continuously develop our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical safety
of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility play an important role here. This is why Fraport
carries out regular training on occupational safety. Employees working on the apron continued to receive training sessions, which began
in 2013, with practical tips on safe driving to avoid specific accident risks. Lightning protection seminars were further events offered to
this group of employees. These allowed employees to learn about electrostatic discharges, dangers posed by thunderstorms, and corresponding protective measures. The Annual Meeting for Safety Officers in 2015 focused on the issue of “traffic safety”. Apprentices in their
first year at Fraport AG received information about occupational health and safety on a safety day. Focal points included ergonomics and
proper lifting and carrying.

G4-LA5 Percentage of employees in job safety committees
An overview of the percentage of employees represented in job safety committees is provided in “G4-LA5 Percentage of employees in
job safety committees”, page 21.
Employees at Fraport AG have an opportunity to contribute to company processes in the area of occupational traffic safety. Fraport has
a system of committees in Frankfurt which focus on occupational traffic safety. Appointments to some of these committees have equal
employee and employer representation.
The Job Safety Committee deals with operational issues relating to occupational safety at the parent company. The permanent members
of the Committee include representatives from the Disabled Employees Committee and the Works Council, the Senior Company Medical
Officer, the Senior Safety Expert, the Executive Director of Labor Relations, and five selected safety officers from the business units. The
opinions of experts from technical departments and experts from the affected areas are sought on defined technical issues in specific
instances relating to job safety, and environmental protection. In 2015, the Committee met four times under the chairmanship of the
Executive Director of Labor Relations.
In 2012, the Group Job Safety Committee was also introduced at Group level. The function of the Committee is to make fundamental
decisions across the Group on standardizing processes in occupational health and safety. One of the tasks of the Committee was to develop overarching occupational safety objectives for the Group in 2015. Permanent members include the Senior Safety Expert, the Senior
Company Medical Officer, the Group Disabled Employees Committee and the Group Works Council, as well as all Executive Managers from
the majority shareholdings at the Frankfurt site. In 2015, the Job Safety Committee met twice. The Executive Director of Labor Relations
also chaired these meetings.

Fraport operates the Traffic Safety Committee as a third forum. Unlike the occupational health and safety committees, this has equal employee
and employer representation from the parent company and meets at least once a month. The Traffic Safety Committee focuses primarily on
increasing traffic safety in the operational and apron areas. A representative from each of the departments is included on this committee
as necessary. The Committee analyzes a variety of different problem areas, such as reported accident events or special traffic problems. It
then uses expert reports to make recommendations on improving the relevant situation to the Company’s management.

Material Aspect: Diversity and Equal Opportunity – Management Approach
As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport values the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches cooperation
and promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically fosters in its
Diversity Management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected in dealings
with others. The Group company agreement “Conduct of Partnership, Diversity and Equality at the Workplace” formed the platform for the
defined key principles such as non-discrimination and equal opportunity. For further information, see the report “2015 Compact”, page
44 et seq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/diversity.html.
Work undertaken by the Diversity Management team in 2015 focused on the development of a suitable diversity strategy and the further
sensitization of employees with regard to the recognition and appreciation of diversity by means of stimulating activities and events (selection):
>> Participation in the third German Diversity Day
Fraport also participated in the German Diversity Day in 2015. A workshop and a keynote speech provided the framework for discussion
of the topic, “Generations at Fraport – Fit for the Future?”.
>> Partnership at work between family and career
Fraport has been involved in a company-wide network of fathers since 2015. The keynote workshop on “Children and Careers – How
Does That Work at Fraport?”, to which men/fathers and women/mothers were invited in equal proportion, launched the network of
fathers at Fraport at the beginning of 2015. Various events, which were attended exclusively by fathers, took place throughout the year.
>> Employee networks at Fraport
In addition to the new network of fathers, the ‘connect’ women’s network for female executives at Fraport and the long-standing ‘Fortissima’ women’s network, created by women working in technical fields at Fraport, meet regularly. The LGBT network (lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender) has been developed, allowing employees from the Group companies to connect and exchange views. The ‘Work
and Care’ network has discovered a new means of collegial exchange and meets regularly at a ‘care cafe’ at the Company’s headquarters.
>> Festival of Abrahamic Religions at Frankfurt Airport
The Festival of Abrahamic Religions has a long-standing tradition at Frankfurt Airport. Representatives of Christians, Jews, and Muslims
and more than 60 invited guests celebrated the joint festival in November for the fifteenth time.
>> IFTAR at the employee festival “Airborne 2015”
In 2015, the start of the fasting month of Ramadan fell at the same time as the employee and family festival, “Airborne”, which is organized
by Fraport every two years. So that Muslim employees and their family members could both attend the employee festival and celebrate
IFTAR, a joint fast-breaking was organized in the culture marquee.

Material Aspect: Equal Remuneration for Women and Men –
Management Approach
As an international company, Fraport encourages diversity in its workforce and acts in accordance with the principle of equality, rejecting
any form of discrimination (see the Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG on www.fraport.com ).
In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account
when assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility
must form the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. Moreover, positions
are usually assessed before they are advertised.
See G4-LA13 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men, page 62.
See G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.

G4-LA13 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 90 % of the employees in the Group work at this site.
In 2013, we participated in a Logib-D consultation promoted by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth
(BMFSFJ) in order to review the actual salary data of female and male employees. After the survey and analysis of the structural data, Fraport AG
was given formal recognition at the start of 2014 that the Company had made equal pay a key strategic issue and that it acted as a role model.

Relevant Aspect: Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms
G4-LA16 Formal grievances about labour practices
The Compliance department received an anonymous tip-off via the Fraport AG ombudswoman that working hours for winter road maintenance were being exceeded on a regular basis (2014/2015 season).
Fraport admitted to the violation following an internal review before the Regional Council of Darmstadt (RP Darmstadt). According to the
RP Darmstadt, employees worked beyond their working hours, which constitutes an offense in accordance with Section 22 (1)(1) of the
Working Hours Act (ArbZG).
The ascertained excessive working hours (concerning 1.3 % of shifts) must be viewed in the context of the total number of shifts completed
by winter road maintenance staff between November 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015.
The RP Darmstadt issued a warning for these violations; no fine was issued. Fraport has taken various measures to prevent such violations
of working hours in the future.
No suppliers made complaints to Fraport AG in connection with work practices during the reporting period.

Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. In 2013,
Fraport published two in-house codes of conduct to establish more firmly these principles within the Company. These two codes commit
employees and suppliers to comply with these fundamental principles. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific topic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/

and Assessment (see “Materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement,
page 35 et seqq).
The German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG) forms a platform for our dealings with members of staff. All level 1 – 4 managers and
employees in human resources services receive regular training in relation to this legislation. Fraport has been developing special e-learning
courses since 2012 with the aim of meeting increased compliance requirements. Introduction of these courses commenced in February
2013. They are intended to support the positive Fraport values culture and assist our employees in correct behavior. They also serve to
inform them about the wide range of topics in the area of compliance.
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility,
monitoring and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page

See also “Employees” in “2015 Compact”, page 42 et seqq., Our Group, page 14.

Material Aspect: Investment – Management Approach
Fraport’s objective is to achieve Group-wide participation in the growth of the aviation market. By implementing investments, Fraport has
significantly increased its capacities at the Frankfurt site and beyond in recent years (see Annual Report 2015, page 32).­Frankfurt Airport is
defined as a significant location of operation. Fraport generated more than 80 % of its revenue at the Frankfurt site in 2015.
Significant factors for selection of suppliers include the principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 of the German Act against Restraints of Competition (GWB).
Significant factors for the selection of suppliers include the following principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 GWB:
>> Competitive principle (the maximum number of bidders should be given the opportunity to offer their services in a formalized procedure)
>> Transparency principle (all bidders should be provided with the same information. The selected procedure must not be changed in an
ongoing commissioning procedure)
>> Equality principle/Prohibition on discrimination (all bidders should be treated equally)
>> Offer based on batch allocation (Major orders should be allotted in specialist batches and sub-batches in order to give small and medium-sized companies the opportunity to submit bids within the scope of their capacity)
>> Principle of profitability (the contract should be awarded to the most cost-effective offer)
When services are put out to tender, Fraport AG usually guarantees compliance with national and international laws. This is again confirmed
in legally binding terms when the contract is signed.
Since the beginning of 2013, we have supplemented this with a Code of Conduct for the suppliers of Fraport AG, and we expect our
suppliers to comply with this code. It is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and is a constituent element of all tenders and
contracts (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).
A specific compliance business partner review was established for the Airport Expansion South project. The aim is to minimize compliance
risks (e.g., corruption, price agreements, fraud, etc.) by becoming more informed about potential future business partners and to detect
potential conflicts of interest. The process, which was established in 2015, provides for a multi-stage, risk-based approach, including integrity checks by external service providers.
Moreover, compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result,
significant compliance Aspects, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and
consulting services (see G4-HR1, page 64).

G4-HR1 Investment agreements and contracts that include human rights clauses
During the reporting period, major investment agreements were concluded as a result of which Fraport acquired shares in another organization or through which an investment project was initiated that was material for the balance sheet. For example, Fraport established three
Group companies in fall 2015 for the planned operation under concession of 14 Greek regional airports. Fraport signed the concession
agreements for the operation of the airports on December 14, 2015.
When services are put out to tender, compliance with national and international laws and agreements is usually guaranteed. This is again
confirmed in legally binding terms when the contract is signed.
Fraport complies with its responsibility in the supply chain and also expects the same compliance from its suppliers and service providers.
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers formulates rules for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers
and service providers with which there is a direct business relationship (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).
Compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant
compliance factors, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and consulting
services. The obligation to adopt the Group CMS Policy for all fully consolidated investments also ensures that Fraport standards for the
compliance management system are implemented in the relevant investments.

Material Aspect: Non-discrimination – Management Approach
As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport values the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches cooperation
and promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically fosters in its
Diversity Management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected in dealings
with others. The Group company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” formed the
platform for defining key principles such as non-discrimination and equal opportunity for the Fraport Group (see http://www.fraport.com/
en/careers/working-at-fraport/diversity.html).

G4-HR3 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken
During the reporting period, no legal actions were filed in relation to the German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG).

Material Aspect: Freedom of Association and
Collective Bargaining – Management Approach
Fraport respects the basic right of freedom of association and collective bargaining under national agreements. We also recognize the right
to open cooperation in a spirit of mutual trust with democratically elected employee representative bodies directed toward a fair settlement
of interests. 99 % of employees in the Fraport Group are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
See G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.

G4-HR4 Freedom of association and collective bargaining
During the reporting period, the rights of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining were not violated in any
business activity nor with any major supplier.
Our Codes of Conduct commit us and our own employees, and all the suppliers and service providers of the Group to these standards
(see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

Suppliers from countries with an increased risk (countries of concern) are reviewed separately. In 2015, we did not place any orders with
companies in countries of concern.
97 % of the order volume placed in 2015 concerned suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic of
Germany, 2.5 % of orders were placed within the EU, and the other 0.5 % was placed in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These
countries have comparable legal principles and standards.
See also G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.

Relevant Aspect: Child Labor
G4-HR5 Principles and measures taken to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor
During the reporting period, no substantial risk of child labor arose from any business activity nor from any major supplier.
The Fraport Group is committed to the abolition of child labor. The minimum age permitting full-time employment in compliance with the
relevant national regulations is observed within the Fraport Group. Fraport has made a commitment to comply with the most important
internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN
Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.– We are consistently working to integrate internationally accredited standards in the areas of human rights, work, environmental protection, and anti-corruption into our processes (see G4-56 Values,
principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.).
97 % of the order volume of the parent company in 2015 was awarded to suppliers and service providers with their head office in the
Federal Republic of Germany, 2.5 % was placed within the EU, and 0.5 % in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These countries
have comparable legal principles and standards in this regard.

Relevant Aspect: Forced or Compulsory Labor
G4-HR6 Principles and measures taken to contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced or
compulsory labor
During the reporting period, no substantial risk of forced labor arose from any business activity nor from any major supplier.
97 % of the order volume placed in 2015 was awarded to suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic
of Germany, 2.5 % was placed within the EU, and 0.5 % in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have comparable
legal principles and standards.
The Fraport Group categorically rejects any form of forced or compulsory labor and has made a commitment to comply with the most
important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance – the principles of the UN Global
Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.– We are consistently working to integrate internationally accredited
standards in the areas of human rights, work, environmental protection, and anti-corruption into our processes (see G4-56 Values, principles,
and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.).
Fundamental responsibility for combating human trafficking or smuggling of migrants lies with the Federal Police. Insofar as possible, Fraport
provides support here by, for example, making video analyses available in compliance with legal restrictions. Knowledge about matters
relevant to security is exchanged in meetings held to ensure that all the organizations and authorities working on security issues provide
mutual support. Before any data are exchanged, the relevant data protection officers are asked to review the data and approve the transfer.
Various security systems are in place at the request of the government agencies depending on infrastructure, processes, and risks. One
example is short-term identification blocks (10 minutes). This procedure prevents repeated use of an ID card at the gates. Where possible,
employee transfer points between Schengen and Non-Schengen zones are installed very close to border control posts.
Clear guidelines and regulations on misuse for all ID card holders are provided in the Airport User Regulation and the ID Card Rules. These
include withdrawal of ID cards/access authorizations.

Relevant Aspect: Security Practices
The Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) came into force in 2005 and regulates, among other things, the checks carried out on air passengers
and their baggage (Section 5 LuftSiG). It also defines the security measures that have to be taken by airport operators (Section 8 LuftSiG)
and the airline companies (Section 9 LuftSiG).
The air security measures in accordance with Section 5 LuftSiG are the responsibility of the Federal Police. The police have appointed Fraport
AG, FraSec GmbH, and another service provider to carry out the air security checks (i.e., checks on persons, hand luggage, and hold luggage).
The security obligations of the airport operator relate to maintaining security and order on the airport site as a prerequisite for guaranteeing
unimpeded operational work processes. The entire airport site must satisfy the defined safety standards. These are based on the requirements
of the Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) and the EU provisions and are divided into different areas for security purposes depending on their
criticality. The airport operator is responsible for carrying out pedestrian and vehicle access checks, and for enforcing checks on people
and goods at access points to critical parts of the security area. This includes checking airport deliveries (deliveries of goods that are not
to be taken onto airplanes into critical parts) and checks on taking prohibited items on board. This means that such operations have to be
carried out in the security zones themselves. Fraport AG has commissioned FraSec GmbH to carry out the checks. Fraport AG must outline
the security obligations incumbent on it in accordance with Section 8 LuftSiG in an aviation security plan. This plan must be approved by
the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport, Urban, and Regional Development as supervisory authority.
In a working group with employees responsible for data protection, video product management, requirements management, users of the
relevant areas, and Corporate Safety and Security, Fraport AG developed and optimized a role and authorization system for the deployment
and use of video technology on the entire airport site with the involvement of the Works Council. This also regulates the use of Fraport
video technology by the authorities.
The system provides clear specifications based on the relevant purpose and requirements under data protection legislation to users and to
internal installers for the installation, configuration, and use of all video data.
Furthermore, a new approval process has been established which is primarily based on the appointment of video officers by the areas deploying this technology. The video officer responsible for ‘Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security’ is tasked by the
Executive Board to centrally coordinate video officers from the different sections. All official matters are also managed by this video officer.
These measures continue to ensure that the requirements for video monitoring are harmonized with the individual rights of passengers,
visitors, and employees.
Boarding cards have included 2D bar codes for some time now and these store personal data about passengers. The systems for processing
data were developed by Fraport in cooperation with customers and Data Protection and they were implemented so that personal data
are only displayed to the inspecting personnel for checking purposes but are not stored, or otherwise processed, or used for any other
purpose. This is not necessary for the operation of the airport.
In order to be in a position to guarantee safety at airports, one of the measures required is that personal access rights must be administered
and checked. At Frankfurt, this is carried out using a new ID card administration system and new access control systems will be used in future
for the gates and for all other access points to operational and security areas. Fraport AG has implemented organizational and technical
measures directed toward the protection of data in order to keep data secure against misuse. Alongside the conclusion of an operating
agreement to regulate the handling of data, all changes in use must be agreed with the Data Protection Officer and the Works Council.
Access to the system is only permitted for a very limited group of people for a specifically defined function and this access is documented
so that any misuse is excluded as far as possible, but any misuse can also be identified and tracked.
All security employees must be trained and officially approved in accordance with statutory requirements. Moreover, all employees with
access to security areas must undergo regular security awareness training.

G4-HR7 Percentage of security personnel trained in the organization’s policies
The training and career development of the entire security personnel is carried out in accordance with statutory regulations and internal
procedures and also encompasses statutory provisions relating to handling people and property. The training requirements are applicable
to the security personnel at Fraport AG and to the personnel of the subsidiary company Fraport Security Services (FraSec) GmbH.

Relevant Aspect: Indigenous Rights
G4-HR8 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples
Fraport respects the rights of indigenous peoples. During the reporting period, there were no incidents affecting the rights of indigenous
peoples.

Material Aspect: Assessment – Management Approach
At all Group sites we have made a commitment to compliance with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to
promote responsible corporate governance – the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor
standards (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html). –
Compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant
compliance factors, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and consulting
services. The obligation to adopt the Group CMS Policy for all fully consolidated investments also ensures that Fraport standards for the
compliance management system are implemented in the relevant investments.
During the reporting period, no grievances were raised against Fraport AG or the investments in relation to human rights which were
submitted through formal, organizational grievance mechanisms (see G4-HR12 Number of grievances about human rights impacts, page
68). For this reason, no improvements had to be made.
See also G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.

G4-HR9 Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews
During the reporting period, none of the investments were the subject of a review and/or impact assessment relating to human rights.
See also “Disclosure of shareholding according to Section 313 (2) of the HGB” (Annual Report 2015, page 194 et seqq.)
The total number of active investments of the Fraport Group classified by countries can be found here (see http://www.fraport.com/en/

Relevant Aspect: Supplier Human Rights Assessment – Management
Approach
G4-HR10 Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using human rights criteria
During the reporting period, no contracts with major suppliers or contractors were rejected on account of human rights criteria or came
into being only due to the inclusion of additional framework conditions. Further screening is therefore not required.

Society
Management Approach SO
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Local communities, Anti-corruption, and Politics (see “Materiality matrix” in “2015
Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 35 et seq.).
A key area of action for Fraport is noise abatement. Fraport AG deployed an “Info Mobile”, which traveled around in the area surrounding the
airport, to engage in dialog with local residents. Fraport employees acted as ambassadors and took part in campaigns held in the region. The
main focus of campaigns was on holding training sessions that provide information on the issues of noise, flight routes, and noise abatement.
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility,
monitoring and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page
37 et seqq.
See also “Community” in “2015 Compact”, page 48 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Local Communities – Management Approach
There is an area of conflict at our main site in Frankfurt. On the one hand, we are responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, the economic
importance of the biggest airport in the export nation Germany, and the prosperity of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. On the other hand,
the downside to this is the noise pollution for those parts of the population who live in the region around the airport.
We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible
effect. This is particularly important against the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic. We therefore defined specific
goals for noise abatement, such as improving the noise situation in the neighboring residential areas and reducing the number of people
affected by noise (see “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.).
See also “Noise Abatement” in “2015 Compact”, page 52 et seqq., “Value generation and engagement in the region”, page 50 et seqq.,
“Growth and development in the Group”, page 38 et seqq., and “Stakeholder dialogs”, page 22.

G4-SO1 Operations with implemented local community engagement
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation. Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and
indirectly to economic and social value creation. Frankfurt Airport, for example, with more than 80,000 direct employees and around 500
companies, is the largest regional place of work in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in enterprises that are appointed
by Fraport for the maintenance and expansion of airport infrastructure. The approx. 5.5 million people who live in the metropolitan region
around the airport benefit from this. They not only benefit from a short trip to fly away on holiday or for business trips, many of them also
work in a company that enjoys a position in close proximity to the airport.
Fraport AG makes an important contribution to the generation of regional value and to social stability at its sites (see “2015 Compact”,
page 50 et seq.).

We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible
effect. This is particularly important against the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic. We therefore defined specific
goals for noise abatement, such as improving the noise situation in the neighboring residential areas and reducing the number of people
affected by noise (see “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq.).
We also make a contribution towards generating regional value at all our other airports where we have a majority holding.
Fraport regularly holds open dialogs with stakeholders (see “2015 Compact”, page 22 et seq.).

G4-SO2 Operations with actual or potential negative impacts on local communities
Airports make a significant contribution to economic prosperity through jobs, tax revenue, and excellent transport connections (see “2015
Compact”, page 50 et seq.). However, their business activities also have disadvantages which exert negative impacts on local communities.
A material Aspect here is noise abatement (see also “2015 Compact”, page 52 et seqq.).

AO8 Number of persons displaced by the airport operator and compensation measures
There were no cases during the reporting period where people were voluntarily or involuntarily displaced by the airport operator.

Material Aspect: Anti-corruption – Management Approach
Fraport has been operating a web-based compliance system based on prevention since 2003. The initial emphasis here was on anticorruption as a result of the expansion of the airport.
Due to the system’s much broader further development into a comprehensive compliance and risk management system, new organizational
structures and content have been developed since 2012. The preventative nature of the compliance, value, and risk management approach
aims to strengthen the compliance culture of our company, while also ensuring governance.
Focal points in 2015 included the implementation of the Group policy on the compliance management system in the investment companies,
the comprehensive compliance risk analysis at Fraport AG and the investments, the revision of guidelines, the expansion of the obligation
to complete e-learning modules to operational managers with personnel responsibility, and training for top executives on antitrust and
competition law.
A significant focal point in 2015 was the comprehensive compliance risk analysis (CRA) which was carried out at Fraport AG and the investments. The aim of the CRA was to obtain a systematic overview of compliance risks in the Fraport Group. The topics of corruption, antitrust
law and competition law, fraud, and the Securities Trading Act were investigated. Detailed questionnaires were developed for this purpose
and were used in various Fraport sections and at 23 investments. Seven questionnaires were developed in relation to corruption which
made a distinction between active and passive corruption within domestic territory and abroad and corruption involving officials within
domestic territory and abroad. The determined compliance risks were restricted to a few sections at Fraport AG and the investments and
were eliminated in 2015 by implemented measures.
An important tool in the prevention and/or detection of breaches is the whistleblower system, which is implemented at many Fraport sites
(see Monitoring and tracking in G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 37 et seqq.).

G4-SO3 Number of operational sites assessed for risks related to corruption risks
and the risks identified
The Internal Audit Department audits all key business units of the parent company, subsidiary companies and joint ventures, and investments
on the basis of an audit plan adopted by the Executive Board. The key emphasis of the audits also involved regularity audits which include
aspects of the audit relating to corruption risks. The focal points of the audits are developed on the basis of a standardized, risk-oriented,
planned approach for annual program planning and the number of regularity audits can therefore vary between five and ten audits each
fiscal year.

A significant focal point in 2015 was the comprehensive compliance risk analysis (CRA) which was carried out at Fraport AG and the investments. The aim of the CRA was to obtain a systematic overview of compliance risks in the Fraport Group. The topics of corruption,
antitrust law and competition law, fraud, and capital market law were investigated. A total of 20 questionnaires were developed for this
purpose and were used in 19 Fraport sections and at 23 investments. Seven questionnaires were developed in relation to corruption which
made a distinction between active and passive corruption within domestic territory and abroad and corruption involving officials within
domestic territory and abroad. The ascertained increased corruption risks were restricted to a few sections/functions at Fraport AG and the
investments and were due to the activity of the section or investment.
There were increased risks for “passive corruption in commercial dealings” and “active corruption involving officials within domestic territory”. Implemented measures have greatly reduced the likelihood of occurrence.

G4-SO4 Information and training on anti-corruption
Fraport parent company
The Executive Board of Fraport AG is informed about compliance activities and progress made on measures to combat corruption in the
form of semi-annual compliance reports. The management bodies do not receive dedicated training.
All employees have access to the Code of Conduct and standards of conduct, which also serve as guidelines for all employees, via internal
information portals.
All business partners are informed about compliance with the Code of Conduct in the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, including the
anti-corruption obligation. These are a central part of the General Terms and Conditions.
Central compliance training sessions on “Giving and Accepting Gifts and Invitations” (anti-corruption training) have been given on an
e-learning platform since 2014. The training concept involved different management levels and functions having the same obligation to
undergo training. Of the 10,219 permanent staff (2014 basis), 4,092 people were obliged to undertake the anti-corruption training in 2015
(40 % of permanent staff). 86 % of level 1 – 5 executives and 86 % of non-management employees required to do the training completed
the “Accepting Gifts” anti-corruption module. 84 % of level 1 – 5 executives and 84 % of employees required to do the training completed
the “Giving Gifts” anti-corruption module.
In-person training sessions on antitrust and competition law were also carried out for top management (43 participants) in the reporting year.

Group
In connection with the compliance risk analysis and mainly due to the execution of the seven questionnaires on corruption, the relevant
executives and the relevant compliance officers of 23 companies underwent training on corruption risks. The training of employees is the
responsibility of their managers. Employee training on the Code of Conduct and standards of conduct, including corruption prevention,
is given when employees start working. Moreover, administrative employees also receive training on corruption risks over internal training
intervals.

G4-SO5 Incidents of corruption and actions taken
Six cases of alleged corruption were reported and investigated in 2015 at the Fraport parent company and the Fraport investments. The
matter is still not resolved in three cases. The allegation of corruption could not be confirmed in two cases following a review of the evidence. In one case, the allegation of corruption turned out to be an ambiguous granting of advantages involving a supplier. It was agreed
with the company that this would cease in the future.

Material Aspect: Public Policy – Management Approach
Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with
our stakeholder groups (see “2015 Compact”, page 22 et seq.).
Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV) (see
http://www.adv.aero/) and Airports Council International (see http://www.aci.aero) Europe, and World. Fraport is also a member of the
Federation of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL) (see http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for Germany and aims to highlight its contribution to safe mobility, climate, and environmental protection. We are working
together with bodies in these organizations to prepare positions on air traffic issues. This includes positions on projected legislation and
political initiatives. Working with trade organizations is a top priority for Fraport. Involvement in trade organizations promotes exchange
of information and cooperation with other airports on current issues relating to traffic policy and sector-specific matters. ADV focuses on
Germany’s importance as a traffic hub. ACI EUROPE and ACI WORLD address issues relating to European and international air traffic. In
Europe, exchange of ideas between hub airports is particularly important because this enables common positions, strategies, and solutions
to be agreed. Working with trade organizations involves a range of different specific issues (e.g., environmental policy, safety measures,
passenger rights, infrastructure development, Single European Sky, etc.). The Fraport Executive Board also plays an active role in the management bodies of the industry associations.

The company makes no financial donations to political parties or institutions.

Relevant Aspect: Anti-competitive Behavior
G4-SO7 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior
In 2015, there were no major legal actions pending nor were any significant legal actions brought to a close which related to anti-competitive conduct and breaches of antitrust law.

Relevant Aspect: Compliance
G4-SO8 Significant fines for non-compliance with laws and regulations
No significant fines were levied on Fraport in 2015 on account of breaches of statutory regulations.

Relevant Aspect: Grievance Mechanisms for Impacts on Society
G4-SO11 Number of neighbor complaints mainly relating to aircraft noise
(no formal complaint procedures)
Following the mediation due to the expansion of Frankfurt Airport, Fraport established two service sections in 2000, Infofon (Info Phone)
and Nachbarschaftsdialog (Neighborhood Dialog), and thus formed the basis for dealing with complaints about aircraft noise on a broad
dialog basis.
Fraport has since provided a central contact point for questions and complaints from residents on aircraft noise, noise abatement, flight paths,
and problems caused by flyovers, noise values, and air quality, and Fraport programs for structural noise abatement and roof protection.
Telephone queries are directed to Infofon. The Infofon team is available around the clock, free of charge. Complex questions are passed
on to the Nachbarschaftsdialog department.
However, Nachbarschaftsdialog employees are also directly available to interested residents via e-mail or letter.

Fraport has been in dialog with more than 45,000 residents of the Rhine-Main region in relation to aircraft noise and noise abatement. In
2015 alone we investigated and clarified 454,506 individual and flight-related aircraft noise complaints caused by flyovers or aircraft noise.
Visitors to our website can find answers to various questions on noise abatement, aircraft noise, and flight operations, including figures,
facts, data, and other opportunities for dialog at http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/info-center.html.
This site is supplemented by www.framap.fraport.de, an interactive map of approach and departure routes, measurement values, route
and runway occupancy figures, aircraft noise contours, and programs of measures, and by http://franom.fraport.de/franom.php, Fraport
Noise Monitoring. These websites allow users to access current noise values at the stationary aircraft noise measurement points operated
by Fraport AG, as well as arrivals and departures at Frankfurt Airport.
The interactive FRA Map also provides extensive information in the form of a report with detailed information on the specific aircraft noise
situation within five kilometers of the user’s residence. The report can be accessed by entering an address at the direct link http://www.
fraport.com/en/responsibility/aircraft-noise-infoservice/info-center.html.
In the last three years, we have recorded a disproportionate increase in complaints relating to aircraft noise in comparison to the number
of complainants, i.e., complainants are making an increasing number of complaints. The increase in the total number of complaints is due
to a small number of complainants. As the complaints are usually not related to specific flight events, it is not possible to process them
individually. The vast majority of residents complain about flight events, however. A continuous decline in both the number of complainants
addressing aircraft noise and complaints about aircraft noise has been recorded in this complaint category.
With regard to key figures, we publish both the total number of messages received and the number of individually prepared complaints,
i.e., excluding automatically generated complaints about aircraft noise, and the number of complainants (see Key figures Environment,
G4-SO11, page 16).

Product Responsibility
Management Approach PR
The following GRI Aspects were defined as material: Customer health and safety, Product and service labeling, and Customer privacy (see
“Materiality matrix” in “2015 Compact”, page 24 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 35 et seq.).
In order to ensure adequate preparation for emergencies, a range of different emergency exercises are regularly carried out at Frankfurt
Airport, for example
> Planned exercises
> Firefighting and rescue exercises
> Exercises for informing relatives, affected airlines, media, and the general public
> Exercises providing initial counseling for uninjured survivors of an accident, their relatives, and people giving assistance.
Alongside smaller exercises, e.g., evacuation of persons from the Skyline, a full exercise is carried out at the airport every two years in accordance with statutory regulations and the international ICAO guidelines. This major exercise involves practicing complex emergencies.
The primary focus is on effective cooperation between internal and external emergency services. The Fraport Emergency Directive (BANOT) forms the basis for planning and coordinating these exercises. The exercise scenarios are planned and carried out as near to reality as
possible, in order to ensure that all the parameters contained in the emergency plan are reviewed – the functionality and effectiveness of
organizational, personnel, and material precautions, as well as the qualifications of the emergency and support personnel. Special training
and career development courses are held for employees at the Emergency Information Center and in Special Assistance Teams (SAT) (see
http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html).
Objectives and measures can be found in the program in “2015 Compact”, page 28 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility,
monitoring and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page

Material Aspect: Customer Health and Safety – Management Approach
The top priority for air traffic is safety. We want to retain the high standard of safety at Frankfurt Airport. A continuous review of all processes
governing safety, training of personnel deployed, and a safety management system enable us to make a significant contribution to safety.
Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage,
and cargo (see “Safety and Security in Air Traffic” at www.fraport.com).
Another central area of action is noise abatement (see “2015 Compact”, page 52 et seqq.). We are committed to taking responsibility and
we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible effect. This is particularly important against
the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic.
In order to reduce the noise pollution created by the operation of the airport, together with our partners from the “Alliance for Noise Abatement” we have implemented a variety of active noise abatement measures and we continue to work on the development and introduction
of additional improvements (for more information, see “Noise Abatement” at www.fraport.com).
A bird strike management system is in place in order to prevent the risk of bird strike at Frankfurt Airport and at the Group airports.
Fraport has a “Wildlife Management” system. Collisions with individual birds or, in particular, flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because
around 70 % of all bird strikes take place at airports or neighboring areas, as an airport operator Fraport is also obliged to minimize this risk.
In contrast to many international airports, in Frankfurt we focus on special biotope management. This concerns making the Airport area
unattractive to relevant birds, i.e., minimizing or avoiding nesting­, resting, and feeding opportunities. The bird strike rate based on verified
notifications from pilots over the past 13 years in Frankfurt was between 2 and a maximum of 3.5 cases per 10,000 aircraft movements.

G4-PR1 Product life cycle stages for which health and safety impacts are assessed for improvement
The top priority for air traffic is safety. By continuously reviewing all safety-related processes, the training of our staff, and a safety management
system, we can maintain the high level of safety at Frankfurt Airport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are
being deployed to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo (see “Safety and Security in Air Traffic” at www.fraport.com).

G4-PR2 Incidents of non-compliance with regulations concerning health and safety impacts
No incidents were recorded for 2015.

Aspect: Business Continuity and Disaster Management
(Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Fraport AG currently has an emergency management system spanning all departments that was implemented on the basis of the Emergency
Plan for Frankfurt Airport, and applies this to all emergency incidents. Each individual incident and the measures taken are documented.
Apart from routine everyday business, winter road maintenance and strikes were a particular issue on the agenda last year. Our crisis team
was also engaged in this matter in our emergency center (ERIC – Emergency Response and Information Center).
Emergency management also covers the care team, where volunteer employees work in the ERIC support team, the special assistance team,
emergency information center, and the basic assistance team. In emergency events or serious operational disruptions affecting Frankfurt
Airport, the ERIC support team supports the crisis team with its work. The special assistance team provides psycho-social frontline assistance
to possible relatives or uninjured affected parties, while the emergency information center is the first telephone contact point for relatives
at the airport and the BAT team helps stranded passengers in the terminal.

Emergency and crisis management comprises the following elements
> Emergency planning
>> Crisis preparation
>> Emergency Response and Information Center (ERIC)
>> Emergency Information Center (NIZ)
>> Special Assistance Team (SAT)
>> Basic Assistance Team (BAT)
>> Emergency exercises
>> Airport fire brigade
>> Airport safety
>> Security control center
>> Medical services
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level.
Events which can impair service quality at the Airport include a breakdown of the Central Airport Information System (INFOplus) or the
electronic gate management system.
Corresponding countermeasures for the failure of a system are laid down in individual section processes.
See also http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html.

Aspect: Service Quality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Service quality is increased by means of the following tools:
1. Fraport passenger survey
>> Each month some 2,400 passengers are asked about their satisfaction with Frankfurt Airport overall and about their satisfaction with
individual criteria (e.g., waiting time at the security checks or friendliness of employees at the information desks). The survey is carried
out at the gates and is linked with the frequent flyer survey “Fraport Monitor”.
>> Analysis: The proportion of passengers (on a scale where one is best and six is worst) who selected one of the best assessment options
(“top box”) is analyzed in terms of global satisfaction and individual aspects. Example: The global satisfaction calculated on the basis of
this method amounted overall to 80 % in 2015, i.e., 80 out of 100 respondents gave a score of 1 or 2 to the item “How satisfied were
you overall with Frankfurt Airport?”.
2. ASQ (airport service quality) survey
>> ASQ is a passenger satisfaction survey initiated by the international airport association ACI which covers more than 200 airports worldwide. Passengers also have the option here to state their overall satisfaction with the airport and with specific services at the airport in
the course of a survey in the gate area. The survey takes the form of a questionnaire.
>> Analysis: The development of an individual airport’s survey results are tracked over time and the relevant position of Frankfurt in comparison with comparable airports is also assessed.
We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Established dialogs include our customer advisory councils and
working groups involving airlines, which meet regularly. Numerous ad hoc meetings also take place on specific topics.
We are also in continuous, close exchange with government agencies.

Aspect: Provision of Services and Facilities for Persons with
Special Needs (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
FraCareServices GmbH is a subsidiary company of Fraport AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and is based at Frankfurt Airport. FraCareServices
GmbH offers services to people with restricted mobility and special needs pursuant to the provisions of EU Directive (EC) 1107/2006.
This service is Fraport AG’s response to the EU Directive. Responsibility for providing assistance at the airport has been transferred by the
airline companies to the airport operators in order to ensure a uniform quality standard for assistance provided to passengers with special
needs and restricted mobility. FraCareServices GmbH has specially trained employees and looks after passengers requiring support in
making their way to and from the aircraft (for more information, see http://www.fracareservices.com/english/).

Material Aspect: Product and Service Labeling – Management Approach
The ongoing economic success of our company depends on the satisfaction of our customers and employees. Prices in line with the market,
the quality of services, and the safety and security of processes (see also the Aspects “Security practices”, page 66, “Business continuity
and disaster management”, page 73 et seq.) are decisive factors here. Fraport has created an integrated management system covering
environmental, occupational safety, and quality management to guarantee a process of continuous improvement in customer and employee
satisfaction. The objective of the management systems at Fraport AG is to secure and improve the quality of all internal business processes
(for more information, see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).
Numerous international and national guidelines and laws regulate air traffic. The Airport User Regulation (see http://www.fraport.com/
en/our-expertise/business-services/policies-and-payment-terms.html) is also applicable. The EU “Rights of Passengers” are also applicable
(See http://www.eu-info.de/static/common/files/view/1294/Amtsblatt_Fluggastrechte_04.pdf). Fundamental principles are also defined
in extensive ICAO and EU regulations governing air traffic and ground handling services (for more information, see http://www.icao.int/).
The Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) came into force in 2005 and regulates, among other things, the checks carried out on air passengers
and their baggage (Section 5). It also defines the security measures that have to be taken by airport operators and the airline companies
(Sections 8 – 9).
The satisfaction of our customers is a top priority in our materiality matrix. We are continually working on improving our tested service
profile in order to retain and further enhance customer satisfaction (see Product quality and customer satisfaction in “2015 Compact”,
page 34 et seqq.).

G4-PR3 Product and service information required by law
Numerous international and national guidelines and laws regulate air traffic. The Airport User Regulation (see http://www.fraport.com/
en/our-expertise/business-services/policies-and-payment-terms.html) is also applicable. The EU “Rights of Passengers” are also applicable
(See http://www.eu-info.de/static/common/files/view/1294/Amtsblatt_Fluggastrechte_04.pdf). Fundamental principles are also defined

G4-PR5 Customer satisfaction
We conduct monthly surveys on passenger satisfaction and these are supplemented quarterly with comparative figures from other airports
from the international ASQ (airport service quality) survey.
Fraport also has a comprehensive feedback and complaints system so that our customers can tell us about their experiences. We are available to customers on Facebook, Twitter, by e-mail, telephone, letter, in person, and on the FRA Airport app and we aim to conclusively
respond to each complaint within five days. Complaints covering some 5,300 issues were received in 2015 (previous year: some 4,700)
while passenger numbers increased. The majority of complaints continued to reach the feedback team via e-mail (80 %) and the proportion of complaints received on social media channels continued to increase. The complaints are dealt with by the relevant departments
and provide ideas for improvements. We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Our customer advisory
councils and working groups meet with the airlines on a regular basis in an ongoing process of dialog within a structured schedule and
framework. Additionally, numerous ad hoc meetings take place to discuss specific subject areas. We also have a continuous, close exchange
of ideas with government agencies.

Relevant Aspect: Marketing Communications
G4-PR6 Advertising standards
Fraport is committed to self-regulation on advertising when making promotional statements and complies with the regulations laid down by
the German Advertising Council. Accordingly, Fraport avoids any form of discrimination, anticompetitive behavior, and misrepresentation
in the advertising material it publishes. Fraport takes particular account of the rules of conduct promulgated by the German Advertising
Council for promotion involving and aimed at children, and operates within the prevailing standards of convention, decency, and morality.
Fraport does not sell any products whose sale is prohibited in specific markets.

G4-PR7 Incidents of non-compliance with regulations concerning marketing communications
No sanctions, fines, or warnings on account of the infringement of advertising standards were issued during the reporting period.

Material Aspect: Customer Privacy – Management Approach
The ongoing economic success of our company depends on the satisfaction of our customers and employees. The security of procedures
and workflows are key factors for this. Fraport has created an integrated management system covering environmental, occupational safety,
and quality management to guarantee a process of continuous improvement in customer and employee satisfaction. This serves as a platform for maintaining and developing a legally compliant and process-oriented organization and is intended to assist in implementing the
vision and goals of our company (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

G4-PR8 Complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy
Fraport did not record any substantiated complaints in 2015.

Relevant Aspect: Compliance
G4-PR9 Fines regarding products and services
No breaches are known at Fraport AG.

About this Report
The “2015 Compact – Gute Reise! We make it

the interested public in brief form about the
economic development of Fraport Group and
its objectives, activities, and progress relating
to responsible corporate management. We
publish additional information using the standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in
a separate report in the core version of the GRI
G4 guidelines, including the industry-specific
additional indicators for airport operators on
our website www.fraport.com/responsibility.

Fraport complies with and supports the ten
principles of the UN Global Compact, develops and executes measures to implement
them, and contributes to their recognition,
even beyond the company’s own limits. This
publication, alongside the GRI report, is also
used as a progress report relating to the implementation of the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact in corporate management.

bearing equal responsibility, not only for our
shareholders and employees, but also for
those who live near the airport. The theme
of active noise abatement and noise reduction continues to be a high priority, despite
the decision to expand. In both aspects, we
have been recognized as of “leading international” importance. To continue to fulfill
this recognition in the future, we carried
out a trial operation of the ‘noise absence
model’ at Frankfurt Airport in 2015. Through
the targeted use of runways, we are able to
afford the residents more quiet during day
and evening hours, depending on the weather and operating conditions. The reduced
noise level at various measurement points
around the airport prove the success of the
‘noise absence model’. We are very aware of
our role in the socienty, and use it to shape
future developments.
This also includes our commitment to climate
protection. We aim to reduce CO2emissions at
the Frankfurt site by 30 percent by 2020. Over
the past year, amongst other measures, we
have renovated some energy-intensive technical systems and retrofitted street lighting

with LED technology. Another project is the
gradual electrification of our vehicle fleet. The
activities leading to more electrical mobility
at Frankfurt Airport are summarized in our
joint project “E-PORT AN” with Lufthansa,
the State of Hesse, and the “Rhine-Main electromobility model region”. ­Our international
sites are also working continuously on reducing their CO2emissions. We are committed
to certifying all fully consolidated airports
via the industry program “Airport Carbon
Accreditation” to at least Level 2 “Reduction”.
Ljubljana Airport already achieved this objective in 2015.

Group in the long term, we have launched various projects to maintain health and develop
careers. We are using targeted diversity management to draw together synergies from our
varied employee base. We also aim to bring
more women into management positions
and offer parents various options to create a
work-life balance.

New trends require new business activities.
One example, which we adopted last year, is

Since January 2015, Qatar Airways has been
using a new generation of energy-efficient,
reduced-noise aircraft on its route between
Doha and Frankfurt. Compared with the
current generation of twin-engine, long-haul
wide-body jets, the A350 XWB uses up to
25 % less fuel and is significantly quieter. As
far back as summer 2014, Fraport welcomed
the test flight of the A350 XWB from Iqaluit in
the Canadian Arctic to Frankfurt.

The Jorge Chavéz International Airport (LIM)
in the Peruvian capital Lima was selected by
passengers for the seventh time in succession
and in total now eight times as the best airport
in South America. The main reasons were the
service quality, professional operations, pleasant atmosphere, and outstanding retail offers.

Fraport AG has extended its sponsorship of
Eintracht Frankfurt and will remain a premium
partner of the football club for another four
years. With the 2015/2016 season the partnership has been in place for 15 years.

fiscal year therefore rose by 10 Euro cents per
share. The last dividend increase dates back
to the 2010 fiscal year.

On the reporting date December 31, 2014,
over 80,000 people – more than ever before
– were employed at the nearly 500 companies
and institutions who took part in the most
recent workplace and employee survey at
the airport. The airport therefore underscores
its position as the largest local workplace in
Germany.

July saw the largest number of passengers in
the history of Frankfurt Airport at 6.2 million.
This exceeded July 2014 by 6.6 % and the
previous record month, August 2014, by
around 130,000 passengers. On a total of
17 days in the month, passenger numbers
were above the 200,000 mark. A new historic
daily record was established on July 31, 2015
with 216,732 passengers.

Fraport and LOT celebrate 50 years of
Frankfurt – Warsaw

Construction starts on T3: groundbreaking
ceremony with 400 employees

Frankfurt leads the rankings as the best airport
in Germany. It was given top grades in the
sub-categories of flight offerings, quality of
stay, and service. In terms of flight offerings,
it is Germany’s largest airport and unbeatable
as one of Europe’s leading airports: Frankfurt
is connected to the world with over 250 flight
destinations and 88 airlines. The number
of international aircraft movements is also
unbeaten.

On September 7, 1965, exactly 50 years
ago, Polish airline LOT commenced scheduled flights between Warsaw and Frankfurt.
After the inaugural flight, the metropolis on
the Main quickly became one of the most
important destinations in LOT’s network. In
the current schedule, the Polish airline offers
three flights a day between the Polish capital
and Frankfurt.

Over 400 employees from all Fraport AG departments broke ground to launch the start
of construction for Terminal 3 on October 5,
2015. They were supported in the symbolic
act by Hesse Minister-President Volker Bouffier,
Frankfurt am Main City Treasurer, Uwe Becker,
the complete Fraport Executive Board, and
Fraport AG Supervisory Board Chairman
Karlheinz Weimar.

Ljubljana awarded for reducing
CO2 emissions
The Fraport subsidiary that operates the Jože
Pucnik International Airport reduced its CO₂
emissions in 2014 by 488 metric tons. This
represents 11 % of the total carbon dioxide
emissions generated by airport operations
in 2012. Ljubljana was awarded Level 2 of
the Airport Carbon Accreditation for this
achievement. The aim is to have completely
climate-neutral operation of the airport by
2020.

Strategic partnership for
cargo handling

Contracts signed for
14 Greek airports

New mission statement introduced for the
Fraport Group

On November 2, 2015, Fraport AG and WFS
also formally completed the strategic partnership for cargo handling agreed in July. As
part of this agreement, Fraport AG sold a 51 %
share in its subsidiary Fraport Cargo Services
GmbH (FCS) located at Frankfurt airport to
WFS, the largest global independent air freight
handler. The joint objective is to increasingly
establish FCS internationally, successfully develop it further, and thus strengthen Frankfurt
as Europe’s largest cargo hub.

Fraport AG and its Greek partner, Copelouzos
Group, signed the concession agreements
to take over 14 Greek regional airports on
December 14, 2015. The concessions were
each initially granted for a period of 40 years.
After the planned closing in fall 2016, the
consortium, in which Fraport AG will hold
the majority share, will pay the concession fee
of €1,234 million. The consortium will then
take over operation and management of the
14 regional airports which also includes the
responsibility for further maintenance and
development.

With the involvement of employees from all
sections of Fraport AG and from Group companies, the Executive Board developed a new
mission statement for the Fraport Group in the
past fiscal year and published it in December.
Under the motto “Gute Reise! We make it
happen”, we state the corporate objectives:
“Growth in Frankfurt and internationally”,
“service-oriented provider”, “competitive
position through optimal cooperation”,
“learning organization”, and “fairness and
acknowledgment”. Considered abstractly,
these goals are represented by the overarching aim of “growth through progress”. Other
components are covered by the corporate values defined under the umbrella term “trust”:
“competence”, “reliability”, “openness”,
“courage”, and “commitment”, and the corporate vision “Fraport – from Frankfurt to the
World. We are Europe’s best airport operator
and set standards worldwide.”

We make it happen

A new mission statement for the Group
Over recent years, the “Agenda 2015” corporate strategy pointed the way for Fraport to
meet the development needs in aviation and
changes to the environmental conditions. We
intensively worked towards and successfully
implemented the fundamental areas of activity
“Manage capital expenditure”, “Strengthen
profitability”, “Increase customer satisfaction”, “Secure sustainability”, and “Utilize
growth potentials” as well as the associated
objectives. For example, various expansion
projects in Frankfurt, such as Runway Northwest and the A-Plus extension to Terminal 1,
were completed on time and on budget.
The investment in the retail business of AMU
Holding at American airports in Pittsburgh,
Boston, Baltimore, and Cleveland, the operation of Ljubljana Airport in Slovenia, and
finally investments in 14 Greek airports provided opportunities for expanding external

Our task
business. And at our main site in Frankfurt,
the improvements particularly in service and
quality of stay ensured significantly improved
customer satisfaction.
With the new mission statement, Agenda
2015 was transformed into a new strategy
that will be rolled out throughout the company in 2016. It will take effect in all areas and
is the guideline for future activity. In addition
to the company’s purpose, it also describes
the goals, values, and vision. The goals
are made manageable for the respective
segments and Group companies, enabling
appropriate strategies to be derived. The
Executive Board and senior management
have taken on the responsibility for setting
and implementing the goals. In 2016, specific
measures and key figures will be created for
achieving the goals.

The new mission statement has created a
clear paradigm shift. Instead of looking from
the perspective of the “airport manager”,
the focus has turned to the customer. Our
processes and our infrastructure should help
our customers have a “good trip”. Fraport has
been working towards this switch for some
years and it is clearly expressed in the new mission statement. The company’s task has been
clearly formulated: We serve our customers
by successfully operating airports worldwide
and providing relevant services. We meet
the prerequisites for international connectivity, economic growth, and prosperity.
In doing so, we want to meet the mobility
requirements of businesses and society, give
our partners a platform for implementing their
business models, and help drive economic
growth and job creation in the regions we
serve, as well as being an attractive employer
and responsible partner.

The newly defined values are used as guide for

they are also the foundation on which the
Fraport Group’s culture is built. Trust forms the
framework for the core values competence,
reliability, openness, courage, and commitment.

“Fraport – from Frankfurt to the World. We
are Europe’s best airport operator and set
standards worldwide.” This is the new vision
for Fraport Group. It emphasizes the Company’s close connection to its home site of
Frankfurt. The impetus for the international
activities starts from there. In Europe, Fraport
measures itself against other airport operators.
Globally, Fraport is successfully expanding its
network and setting standards in the operation of international airports along with the
associated services.

Fraport is committed to these core values.
They should in future shape the way our
employees interact with partners, neighbors,
and customers.

Five goals
“Growth through progress” is the umbrella
that covers the Group’s five goals. Here,
growth emphasizes the quantitative direction,
i.e., growth as a management task, as an economic dimension. In contrast, progress relates
to the qualitative aspects and is aimed at continuous improvement, innovative strength,
and development.

The existing strategic direction and ongoing
initiatives of the Group are therefore appropriately summarized under these new goals.
The goals will be made more specific with
appropriate strategies in 2016.

Fraport will further ensure the appeal and
success of the Frankfurt site. The next major
step in infrastructure development is the
construction of Terminal 3. This will create
the necessary capacity for traffic development
in the coming years. The available expertise
held and expanded by Fraport in Frankfurt is
also a guarantee for success when developing
and expanding international Group companies. In order to support growth, Fraport
will strengthen its leadership in innovation
and develop new business models that are
customer-oriented.

As a service-oriented provider, Fraport
focuses on its customers. Whether passengers,
aviation companies, the cargo community,
concessionaires, tenants, or consulting customers, they all receive the best service and
high quality. Fraport anticipates and fulfills the
wishes of the customers whilst at the same
time ensuring economic efficiency. Product
developments, services, and other offerings
are derived from this. The digitalization of
airport processes and services will play a
special role here.

From Frankfurt to the World
The Fraport Group (hereinafter also referred
to as: Fraport) is among the leading global
airport operators with Frankfurt Airport and
its international portfolio of investments.
The range of the Group includes all services
of aviation and terminal operation as well as
associated services. The further development
of airports into integrated mobility, event, and
real estate locations additionally represents
a broad revenue and earnings basis for the
Group.
The Group’s key driver of revenue and earnings
is Frankfurt Airport, one of the largest passen-

ger and cargo airports in the world. In contrast to time-limited concession models, the
Fraport Group parent company, Fraport AG
Frankfur t Airpor t Ser vices Worldwide
(Fraport AG) wholly owns and operates
Frankfurt Airport with no time limits. With
over 10,500 employees, Fraport AG, which
has been stock exchange-listed since 2001,
is also the single biggest company of the
Fraport Group, which has around 20,700
employees. It directly or indirectly holds the
shares in the Group companies and has its
head office in Frankfurt am Main. In addition
to Frankfurt, Fraport is active in 13 other

airports on four continents through majority
and minority investments.
Alongside its Greek partner, Copelouzos
Group, Fraport signed concession agreements
to operate 14 mainly tourist-oriented regional
airports in Greece at the end of the last fiscal
year. We are currently expecting to take over
airport operation at the end of 2016, thus
expanding our international portfolio.

“The Supervisory Board involves itself intensively in the Group’s internationalization strategy.
We have also supported the progress of the tender won back in 2014 by the consortium
comprised of Fraport and Copelouzos Group for concessions at 14 Greek regional airports.
During an extraordinary meeting on October 5, 2015, we approved the signing of the final
concession agreements, which then took place on December 14, 2015. We are convinced that
the Fraport management will continue to successfully and profitably contribute its expertise
in the operation of airports.”

The relative ownership interests were adjusted to the current total number of shares as at December 31, 2015 and therefore may differ from the
figures given at the time of reporting or from the respective shareholders’ own disclosure. Shares below 3 % are classified under “free float”.

The Group companies consolidated under
IFRS recorded a revenue of €2,583.3 million
and EBITDA of €848.8 million during the past
fiscal year. Including the other Group companies, Fraport generated a Group result of
€297.0 million in 2015. Whereas the Frankfurt
site contributed around 63 % to the Group
result, Fraport generated somewhat more
than one third of the profit outside Frankfurt.

Organization

Executive Board is responsible for operational
management and leads the company. At the
end of 2015, it comprised four members,
Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chairman), Anke Giesen
(Operations), Michael Müller (HR Director),
and Dr. Matthias Zieschang (Controlling and
Finance).
The Supervisory Board appoints the Executive
Board and monitors its activity. It exists under
German law and, as a result of the size of the
parent company, comprises 20 members who
are appointed or elected by shareholders and
company employees in equal numbers.

Fraport AG is a public limited company under German law – accordingly, the senior
management and control are divided up As an additional decision-making and control
between three independent bodies. The body, the shareholders of Fraport AG make

use of their discussion and voting rights at the
Annual General Meeting. The Annual General
Meeting takes place in the first six months of
each fiscal year and makes decisions on all
tasks assigned to it by law and the Group’s
articles of association, such as appropriation
of profit, election and discharge of the Supervisory Board, and discharge of the Executive
Board. Each share provides one voting right.

Updating the materiality matrix
The systematic exchange of information with
our internal and external stakeholders enables
us to develop perspectives for the strategic
alignment of the company. As of 2010, we
have used this to create a materiality matrix
that depicts the company’s future challenges.
The matrix is reviewed annually to ensure it is
up-to-date and, if necessary, adjusted. In the
course of aligning sustainability reporting
with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI)
G4 guidelines, in 2015, the materiality matrix
needed to be developed to focus it even
more on the central areas of activity for the
company’s sustainability.

Fraport’s management and representatives
of our most important stakeholders (airline

shareholders, analysts, employees, employee
representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific
bodies, NGOs, local residents living near the
airport) confirmed the relevance of the
ten newly defined areas of activity for the
company’s sustainability in an online survey.

Climate protection: Increasing energy efficiency, monitoring and reducing emissions
of climate-relevant gases through airport
operation (e.g. CO2).
Conservation of nature and resources:
Careful use of natural resources; minimization of waste and air pollutant emissions
and immissions through airport operation,
and preservation and encouragement of
biodiversity on the airport site.

New program
Our program regarding strategically important topics for responsible corporate management is structured analogously to the areas
of activity included in the materiality matrix.
The update meant the previous agenda had
to be revised. We have set concrete targets
and defined the measures required to achieve
them. In comparison to last year, we aimed to
restrict targets to between two and three per
area of activity. Each target is measurable and
recorded using at least one key performance
indicator (KPI). The KPIs enable the degree
to which targets have been achieved to be

shown transparently. The agenda is reviewed
and updated annually.

and achieving the targets lies with the relevant
departments. You can find the complete program on the following pages.

Economic enhancement

Economic enhancement
We consider “economic enhancement” to mean the continuous increase of our company’s
value and the safeguarding and improvement of profitability while maintaining a financial
balance. The goal of economic enhancement is to achieve profitable growth and the long-term
generation of a positive value added in all business areas. As such, we manage the Group’s
development according to the principles of value management. The key figure for this is the
Fraport value added.* We use retained earnings as the basis for future capital expenditure
and to further increase the company’s value.

* Fraport value added indicates the difference between EBIT and capital costs (= Fraport assets × cost of capital rate).
As of the beginning of fiscal year 2015, pre-tax results and the carrying amounts of associates have been added
to EBIT and Fraport assets. In this way, Fraport takes account of both consolidated Group companies and companies
accounted for using the equity method in value management.

The customer is our main focus. We consider
passengers, airlines and the freight community
to be our main customers. We want to win
them over with attractive offers and the best
service. Fraport AG’s sites are an optimal environment for tenants. We cooperate closely
with the authorities, especially in terms of
security. We consider the satisfaction of our
customers to be a key measure of our success.
In 2015, passengers at our Frankfurt site once
again confirmed their satisfaction with us, with
global satisfaction at 80 %. This means we
have reached our ambitious target (≥ 80 %
global satisfaction) for the fourth year in a row.
As in the two previous years, in 2015, Frankfurt Airport was awarded the title “Service
Champion” in the rankings of market research
company ServiceValue and the ‘Die Welt’
newspaper. Among the almost 2,000 companies and organizations rated, FRA once
again achieved a gold medal position and is
also once again the industry leader among
German airports, with more than 8 million
passengers a year.
Frankfurt was also named “Germany’s best

Our Customer Service Center offers our

Together with airlines, we celebrate the opening of new routes or the introduction of new

result significantly exceeded the previous

number of intercontinental passengers who
usually spend more during their stay in the
airport than passengers traveling within
Europe. The relative weakness of the Euro,
which made it cheaper for many customers
to shop in Frankfurt using foreign currency,
also made a positive contribution.

growth in traffic numbers in a range between
1 % and 3 % for the 2016 fiscal year. Mixed
development is expected for the airports
outside Frankfurt. The investments in Lima
and Xi’an in particular should show consistently high momentum, whereas Antalya and
St. Petersburg Airports are suffering significantly from the political crisis between Turkey

recent terrorist attacks in Turkey. For Ljubljana

Ideas and innovation
Development of new products or approaches that solve a problem more efficiently or satisfy requirements better than

Innovations as a key to competitiveness
At Fraport, supporting innovation is embedded in both the corporate objectives and the

Fraport has been working with the “House of
Logistics and Mobility” since its foundation
in 2009. The platform for interdisciplinary
and cross-industry cooperation between
business, science, politics, and civil society
in the Frankfurt suburb Gateway Gardens is
located right next to the airport. The focus
is on coordinated cooperation with other
companies and regional academic institutions.
The aim is to support innovative logistics
projects and technical developments and to
further increase the appeal of the Frankfurt
site. Fraport also benefits from the academic
research at Frankfurt University of Applied
Sciences, which is located at HOLM. Jointly
defined problems are discussed on site at
Frankfurt Airport and supported by Fraport.
These include numerous academic theses.

Good idea: spare parts without extras
If aircraft cannot park directly at the terminals but are instead held in “apron areas”,
passengers are transported to them using buses. Constant use wears out the motors on
the bus doors particularly quickly. Replacement motors could only be acquired from the
manufacturer with the associated drives. Four employees from the “Integrated Facility
Management” section had a good idea in this context. As the drives are rarely defective,
Marc Weinberg, Steffen Planitz, and Marcel Hotz (from left) looked for another supplier
who can provide a motor without a drive. This significantly reduced the costs of the spare
part and installation also takes substantially less time.

Constantly improve employee satisfaction
With the Fraport Barometer, we use an online survey to collect such information as employee
satisfaction within the Group. In 2015, the grade improved to 2.85** (2014: 2.89; index
value using German school grade system). Fraport aims to constantly improve employee
satisfaction. Both company-wide activities and department-specific initiatives and the
evaluation of these aim to contribute to this.
The average grade for employee satisfaction in the parent company was significantly
better in the past fiscal year at 2.78 than in the previous year (2014: 3.14). The results
improved for all key issues, where satisfaction with the “technical ability of managers” was

Occupational health and safety
Maintaining and encouraging employees’ physical and mental performance using appropriate occupational
health and safety measures.

Investing in health
Maintaining the long-term health, performance, and therefore the productivity of our
employees is now more than ever the focus
of our HR management when faced with the
changing age structure within the Group.
Through our preventive occupational health
and safety management, we contribute to
maintaining the performance of our employees and prevent health risks arising at work.
The increasing requirements for efficiency
and flexibility as well as physically demanding activities in operational areas can be
burdens that have to be dealt with at an early
stage. The rising average age of employees
represents an additional challenge. Our employees are regularly informed about healthy
measures and behaviors, as well as how to
set up their workstations ergonomically. To
protect their health, our prevention program
ranges from regular occupational health
checks to tailor-made offerings.
The aim of the “Fraport is/eats healthy”
nutrition campaign that started at the end of
2015 is to achieve a healthier lifestyle. In a comprehensive initial event with preparatory workshops and complemented by specialist presentations, employees obtained information

Accidents reduced
Fraport ensures high occupational safety
standards. Comprehensive measures are
required, for example, when handling hazardous materials, in ground services handling
processes, in maintenance, in internal transport and traffic, and during infrastructure
construction activities. The aim is to reduce
the number of notifiable work accidents in
the Group per 1,000 employees to below
30 at the Frankfurt site in 2020 and for it to
continue to reduce.

The measures paid off: The rate per 1,000
employees at Fraport parent company fell
significantly from 26.7 in the previous year to
20.7 in 2015. The total number of workplace
accidents including commuting and sports
accidents was 680 and therefore a noticeable
62 fewer than the previous year’s figure of
742. Due to thorough prevention work there
were fewer accidents particularly in ground
handling services and airport security. The
rate per 1,000 employees was 27.8 for the
Group at the FRA site.

Training on the apron
After a six-month test phase, in which both the functionality of the “fitness mobile” in daily
work and the direct effects on employee absence were observed, Fraport converted a light
truck into a mobile training center in 2015. The vehicle is equipped with training devices
to strengthen stomach and back muscles and support spine flexibility. Fraport thus enables
employees to strengthen their muscles selectively on the apron, close to their workstations,
and during working hours. A team of qualified trainers supports the exercises. Even in the
test phase, absence times due to musculoskeletal problems were reduced, especially in
the quarter immediately following the test phase. In addition, the new offer also aimed
to bring about a long-term change in behavior by the employees in favor of their health.

largest regional place of work in Germany.
Additional employment effects are also

committed to the business location and the
metropolitan area. These activities include
participation in the economic initiative
“Wirtschaftsinitiative FrankfurtRheinMain”,
in which 150 companies are involved. As a
co-founder, Fraport has been active in it as
of 1996 and provides the executive management. The initiative works towards making
the metropolitan area more attractive at the
economic, scientific, and cultural level, thus
positioning it in the best possible way compared to competitor locations. One result of
the collaboration is the House of Logistics
and Mobility (HOLM) center of excellence at
its site at the airport. This economic initiative
is also a project partner for the further development of the RhineMain Regional Park,
the largest project sponsored by the Fraport
Environmental Fund.
In addition to our commitment to the business location, in line with our motto “Active

Health risks lower than assumed
On behalf of Gemeinnützige Umwelthaus
GmbH (UNH) in Kelsterbach, a subsidiary of
the state of Hesse, experts investigated the
impact of traffic noise in the period from April
2011 to October 2015. The NORAH (“NoiseRelated Annoyance, Cognition, and Health”)
study was financed by the state of Hesse,

Climate protection
Increasing energy efficiency, monitoring and reducing emissions of climate-relevant gases
through airport operation (e.g. CO2).

Climate protection (voluntary) commitment
Climate protection is a key challenge of our
time. This is because the emission of CO2
and other greenhouse gases in electricity
generation, transport, and industrial production makes a decisive contribution to global
warming. In 2015, delegates from 195 countries met for the global climate conference in
Paris and agreed the first climate agreement
to be binding for all the world’s countries. It
will come into force in 2020 and has the aim of
stopping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the end of the 19th century,
but at minimum limiting it to less than two
degrees Celsius. From 2050, net emissions are
to be reduced to zero, i.e., an equilibrium is
to be reached between the emission of greenhouse gases and their capture – for example
through forests or technical means.

as the Renewable Energies Act and the
Energy Saving Act. Voluntary reduction targets by German companies make an important contribution to implementing national
policy. Fraport has also committed to do this.
The International Energy Agency attributes
approximately 2 % of CO2 emissions caused by
humans globally to civil aviation. In contrast
to airlines, airport operation only represents
a very small proportion of this.

binding targets for CO2 reduction for individual states. Instead, 186 countries submitted
voluntary commitments to climate protection.
According to the agreement, these selfimposed targets are to be reviewed and tightened every five years. Developed countries
are responsible for submitting quantifiable
commitments for CO2 reduction, while the
other countries are at least encouraged to do
so. In addition, the old developed countries
are to provide $100 billion per year from 2020

climate change and reform their energy supply.
Germany strongly supported the climate

the increasing use of renewable energies and

Fraport AG has decided to certify all fully consolidated airports in accordance with Airport
Carbon Accreditation. The intention is to
achieve at least Level 2 – “Reduction”. For this,
airport operators must demonstrate effective
CO2 management and CO2 reduction. The
next steps are then Level 3 – “Optimization”
and Level 4 – “Neutrality”. We already reached
Level 3 at the Frankfurt site in 2012. Ljubljana
Airport reached Level 2 in the reporting year
as a result of appropriate measures.

30 % less CO2 by 2020
For our largest site in Frankfurt, we have set
ourselves detailed targets for CO2 reduction.
We want to reduce the CO2 emissions that
Fraport AG itself is responsible for at the
Frankfurt site by 30 % per passenger or per
100 kg of cargo by 2020 in comparison to
2005 levels. Our second target corresponds to
this: Absolute CO2 emissions are not to exceed
238,000 metric tons in 2020.

In addition to fleet management and the energy-efficient planning of new buildings, energy
management in existing terminals, buildings,
and facilities is our greatest lever in respect of
CO2 savings. To reach the target, it is crucial
to increase energy efficiency in operations –
approximately 86 % of Fraport AG’s CO 2
emissions are created in these areas. In 2015,
for example, we optimized two ventilation systems in Terminal 1, thereby saving 1,750,000
kWh of electricity and 537 metric tons of CO2.
Converting the street lighting on the access
roads to Terminal 1 to LED technology saves
another 121,000 kWh or around 52 metric
tons of CO2 a year.

A15 becomes the “Green Gate”
“E-PORT AN” is a joint initiative by Fraport,
Lufthansa, the state of Hesse and “RhineMain Model Electro-Mobility Region”. The
aim of the various projects bundled under its
umbrella is the reduction of CO2 emissions in

aircraft handling. There is to be more testing
of alternative drive technologies. Up to 20
different vehicles are used in aircraft handling.
As the first step, E-PORT AN consolidates electric vehicles already available and integrates
electrically operated new developments into
the handling process. CO 2 emissions and
noise are decreasing as a result, which in
addition to the environmental footprint also
improves working conditions on the apron. In
addition, the impact of the large-scale use of
electric vehicles on the airport’s power grid
are observed.
In 2015, Fraport and its partners opened the
first “Green Gate” at Frankfurt Airport. From
now on, passengers at Gate A15 can read
about the numerous projects on the subject of
e-mobility. The activities are presented using
models and information boards, and include
solar-powered passenger stairways, electric
conveyor belt vehicles, hybrid aircraft tractors
and electric pallet trucks.

Conservation of nature and resources
Careful use of natural resources; minimization of waste and air pollutant emissions
through airport operation, and preservation and encouragement of biodiversity on the airport site.

Conserving natural resources
As transport hubs, airports are sites where
resources are used intensively. It is our aim
to organize this so that resources are used as
sparingly as possible. We consider ourselves
responsible for protecting the environment
at our sites. We also expect our suppliers and
service providers to do the same, and this is
therefore included in our Code of Conduct for
suppliers that has been in force for the Frankfurt site as of 2013 and Group-wide as of 2014.
In Frankfurt, a detailed record was made of the
local flora and fauna as part of the zoning plan
for the expansion of the airport in 2005. In
addition, we have been carrying out intensive
environmental monitoring around the airport
as of 2010.

Even after expanding via Runway Northwest, Frankfurt Airport is one of the most
compact major airports in the world with an
area of around 22 square kilometers. Of this
terrain, approximately half is unpaved. The
largest continuous open area is in the area
of the runways. This extensively maintained

permanent grassland is a high-quality habitat
which is home to rare and endangered animal and plant species. Where possible we
expand green spaces. For example, several
environmental green roofs are planned for
the new buildings in CargoCity South.

Biotope management against bird strike
Collisions with large birds or flocks of birds are a particular source of danger for aircraft.
As around 90 % of bird strikes take place close to airports, airport operators are obliged
to minimize this risk. Unlike at other international airports, in Frankfurt we do not focus
on driving birds away, but on special biotope management. For example, the site has
been made unattractive for typical bird strike species, such as geese, with particularly
high growing grasses. Hatching and rest opportunities for such species are minimized
or avoided. This particularly benefits a large number of smaller bird species such as the
skylark, which do not represent a danger for flight operation. The bird strike rate based on
verified reports by pilots has been at between 2 and a maximum of 3.5 cases per 10,000
aircraft movements in Frankfurt for the past 13 years.

Environment

2015 Compact

In close proximity to the airport and further
afield, as part of the mitigation and coherence measures in the zoning plan for the
expansion, a total area of 2,312 hectares was
upgraded for nature protection. High-quality
habitats such as deciduous forests, orchards,
wetlands, and low-nutrient habitats are
being developed. The compensation for
the construction of the new Terminal 3 is
already included in this extensive package of
measures. In addition, we support projects for
preserving ecosystems and biodiversity in the
Rhine-Main area with funds from the Fraport
Environmental Fund.

Rainwater for flushing toilets
Operating an airport requires a lot of water
and, at the same time, produces a large quantity of waste water. When dealing with the
legally protected resource of water, Fraport
takes all aspects of modern water management into account. This includes managing
consumption and quality control of the water
that enters the ecosystem.
We use water sparingly at Frankfurt Airport and
employ, among other things, water-saving
techniques in sanitary facilities and recycling
systems in vehicle washing facilities. In addition, where possible we use raw water instead
of drinking water. To do this, we collect rainwater in CargoCity South and Terminal 2 and
supplement it from our own groundwater

wells or with treated water from the River
Main. We use the raw water in sprinkler systems, toilet, and for irrigation of green areas.
The raw water supply in CargoCity South
is being expanded across the board. In the
north, Terminal 2 is supplied with raw water,
and Terminal 1 and the neighboring office
building are 70 % connected. Full supply is
planned by 2016. In the past 15 years, raw water as a percentage of Frankfurt Airport’s total
consumption has increased to around 20 %.
Dirty water from toilet facilities, restaurants,
aircraft toilets, and aircraft washes from the
northern part of the airport is treated in
city treatment plants. We operate our own
treatment plant in the southern area. The
rainwater from the apron, from de-icing areas,
roads, and roofs flows through various security
facilities and filter systems and is then channeled into local bodies of water or seepage
facilities. The agents used to de-ice aircraft
and the operating areas in Frankfurt are readily
biodegradable and meet strict environmental
requirements.

Avoid waste, recycle, and recover energy
The principle of Fraport’s waste management
is to recycle or recover energy from unavoidable waste as far as possible. In Frankfurt,
non-hazardous waste is, for example, handled in sorting and recycling facilities, or
the energy from it is thermally recovered in

61

waste-to-energy plants. The hazardous waste
produced is collected separately and, as far as
possible, subjected to a recycling or recovery
procedure. Where there are no recycling or
recovery options, the waste is disposed of in
a suitable incineration plant or in a physicochemical treatment plant. In 2015, Fraport
disposed of 21,490 metric tons of waste at
Frankfurt Airport. The proportion of hazardous
waste was approximately 7.4 %. The recycling
and recovery rate stayed at a very high level
at around 89 %.

Air quality at city level
Air pollutants arise at airports primarily in
connection with flight operation, but apron
and vehicle traffic also lead to the emission
of pollutants into the air. At Frankfurt Airport
we have been continuously monitoring emissions of pollutants as of 2002 at up to five air
measurement sites. The measurement results
prove that air quality on the airport site has
remained at city level since the commencement of monitoring. The use of electrically
powered apron vehicles also contributes to
the reduction of emissions on the apron.
