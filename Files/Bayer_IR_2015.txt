Chairman‚Äôs Letter

Investment in the future

2015 marked a decisive year in the history of our company. We successfully executed all the necessary steps to transform Bayer into
an integrated Life Science company. For more than 150 years, the
core of Bayer‚Äôs business model has been to invent new molecules
and turn them into innovative products. Now we are focusing solely

across the board ‚Äì from research to product approval processes
and from operations to talent development. It is important to
sustain this momentum and continue reaping the fruits of our
strategy.
In order to leverage our focus, we have given our organization a
clear, integrated and more operations-based structure. Since January 2016, the heads of our new divisions ‚Äì Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science ‚Äì have been members of the Board
of Management of Bayer AG. This enhances operational accountability and accelerates decision-making, which are important for
an innovation company. In this connection, I‚Äôm proud of the extensive measures we have taken to broaden Bayer‚Äôs diversity in terms

employees.
In 2015, revenues from continuing operations rose to a record
level of more than ‚Ç¨46 billion. On a currency- and portfolioadjusted basis, this is an increase of 2.7 percent. Our clean ebitda
rose substantially by more than 18 percent to ‚Ç¨10.3 billion, and
core earnings per share advanced by 16 percent to ‚Ç¨6.83. Our innovative new products especially contributed to this success and
also played a substantial role in making 2015 another record year
for Bayer. All three new divisions posted above-market growth.

of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion, compared with ‚Ç¨2.9 billion in 2014.
At Consumer Care (now called Consumer Health), currencyand portfolio-adjusted sales growth was 6.1 percent. During the
past year, we successfully integrated the business acquired from
Merck & Co., Inc.
Despite a weaker market environment, CropScience raised sales
by 1.7 percent on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. Of the
regions, Europe showed the strongest growth, which was driven by
the positive development of crop protection products and seeds.
Thanks to the ongoing support of our investors, Bayer continued to
have the highest market capitalization of all the dax companies in
2015. And despite a challenging market environment, we successAPGGT¬øJ<O@?JPMAJMH@M(<O@MD<G.>D@I>@NP=BMJPKJIOC@NOJ>F

for the future!
In addition to the ipo of Covestro, we undertook further transactions
in support of our strategy. In June 2015, we signed an agreement to
sell the Diabetes Care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. In July 2015, we closed the acquisition of
SeedWorks India Pvt. Ltd., based in Hyderabad, India.
Over the years, our portfolio strategy has consistently enhanced our

the consumer health businesses of Merck and Dihon in 2014 gave
our Consumer Health business the necessary critical mass to operate as a separate division.

Being successful as a Life Science company requires a pronounced
innovation culture that is the breeding ground for new ideas and
facilitates their translation into successful products. It often all
starts in the laboratory which is why, between 2011 and 2015, we
increased our annual research and development spending by ‚Ç¨1.4
billion to ‚Ç¨4.3 billion. This is a substantial investment in our future.
At the same time, we have become better and faster at bringing
our innovations to market.
At the end of 2015, we established our new Bayer Life Science
Center. This strategic innovation unit has been designed to help
uncover, encourage and unlock breakthrough cross-species technologies and know-how for Bayer by enabling collaborations with

This is my last Chairman‚Äôs Letter to you as ceo of Bayer. I am thankful for your continued trust and support. It has been an extremely
rewarding experience for me to have the opportunity to lead such a
fantastic company to new heights. I have enjoyed working with so
many great colleagues, and while I contributed with my know-how
to our joint success, I feel I learned just as much in turn.
Bayer is an iconic brand, offering an endless source of innovation.
With its solid foundation and a deep management bench in place,
I am convinced that Bayer can continue its journey as one of the
most innovative companies in our industry.

For the
heart
A heart attack is invariably a severe
setback in life. Leading a healthy lifestyle
and regularly taking the right medication
can reduce the risk of a second heart
attack or secondary complication.

Cardiologist Dr. Anne-Katrin Sch√§tzle examines
her patient Axel Vogel at the Cardiology Center
of Cologne University Hospital.

Cologne // germany. ‚ÄúNothing is ever the same again,‚Äù says Axel Vogel.
Six years ago, a myocardial infarction threw life off course for the now
57-year-old from Kerpen, Germany. Remigius M√ºller (52) from Rottweil,
near Stuttgart, survived the same life-changing experience. A blood clot
in a coronary vessel turned his life upside down in a matter of seconds:
M√ºller suffered a heart attack at age 45. Until then, the plant manager had
always thought: ‚ÄúHow could anything stop me?‚Äù This attitude helped him
cope with a busy life for years. Both men have changed their habits since
their heart attacks. As they now know: ‚ÄúIt‚Äòs an experience you never want
to go through again.‚Äù

14

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Magazine // Life Science

But both men are also aware that they might have to.
‚ÄúWhen people have already survived one heart attack, the
risk of having another increases for the rest of their lives,
meaning that long-term medical care is imperative,‚Äù explains Dr. Wolfgang Steffen, a cardiologist in Rottweil
and M√ºller‚Äôs attending physician. Alongside the management of cardiovascular risk factors in line with standard
care practice and any necessary lifestyle changes, an especially important part of treatment is that patients regularly take their prescribed medication, including drugs
that counteract blood-clotting and therefore help prevent
another heart attack. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also very important for patients
to be aware of the many things they can do to help their
heart recover,‚Äù Steffen emphasizes. ‚ÄúIn concrete terms,
that means no smoking, a different diet, regular exercise,
minimized alcohol intake, stress reduction and, if necessary, treatment for depression.‚Äù His patient, Remigius
M√ºller, has taken this advice to heart. He wouldn‚Äôt even
think of skipping his medications. Apart from acetylsalicylic acid, which inhibits platelet aggregation, he also
takes blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering medication. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain that the drugs are the reason I feel well
again today,‚Äù he says.
Axel Vogel is likewise thankful for the opportunities
afforded by modern medicine. ‚ÄúThey enable me to reach
the best level of performance I am still capable of.‚Äù

heart attack. He suffers from arrhythmia and had a
pacemaker implanted three years ago. In addition,
his heart function has deteriorated over the years
and along with it his performance capabilities.
Just climbing a few stairs wears him out. Because
of his extreme heart failure, Vogel has been in
treatment for some time under Professor Volker
Rudolph, Chief Senior Physician of the Cardiology
Center at Cologne University Hospital.
Heart failure is one of the potential complications
following a heart attack. ‚ÄúTwenty to 30 percent of
patients who have had a heart attack subsequently
develop heart failure,‚Äù reports Rudolph. It is a
very serious condition, especially in its advanced
stages. The heart is unable to pump blood through
the body, causing the energy levels of sufferers to
drop dramatically. ‚ÄúThe survival time for severe
C@<MOA<DGPM@DNNDBID¬æ><IOGTNCJMO@MOC<IAJMNJH@

limited. A lot of research needs to be done in the

in halting or possibly even healing pathological
changes in the heart and blood vessels by means
of regenerative therapy, it would be a major step
forward.‚Äù
Developing innovative active substances to
treat heart failure is one of Bayer‚Äôs main areas of
research. Several projects involving different
treatment methods are currently in the advanced
phases of clinical development. Furthermore,
Bayer scientists in the cardiovascular research unit
are working on novel active ingredients to treat
severe diseases of the cardiovascular system such
as coronary heart disease, stroke, thrombosis and
pulmonary hypertension, as well as certain kidney
diseases. ‚ÄúCardiovascular diseases are a strategic
priority for Bayer. Our pipeline covers a wide
range of heart, circulatory and vascular diseases,
for which patients and physicians are desperately
waiting for further improved treatments,‚Äù says
Professor Andreas Busch, head of Drug Discovery
in the Pharmaceuticals Division.

Henry is an example which shows that being old doesn‚Äôt
automatically mean being sick. ‚ÄúBut the rising life expectancy also means a higher risk for numerous disorders,
many of which are chronic conditions,‚Äù says Dieter

Bayer‚Äôs scientists are concentrating on new therapeutic
options for conditions such as heart failure, wet agerelated macular degeneration, and prostate and lung cancer. The results of this research could make it possible
for elderly people to live an active life for longer.

As extreme weather is likely to continue to be a
major problem in the future, Bayer has developed
seed that is able to survive being immersed for
14 days. The market introduction is scheduled for
2016. In 2017, Bayer plans to launch a new Arize‚Ñ¢

The demand for wheat will increase by
approximately 60 percent by 2050.

Kansas // United States. *IOC@JOC@MND?@JAOC@+<>D¬æ>
some 14,000 kilometers to the east of Vietnam in the u.s.
state of Kansas, wheat farmer Craig Reed is just as embattled by the vagaries of the weather as his colleagues in
Asia. ‚ÄúDrought is the main reason for harvest failures in
wheat,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe need about 50 centimeters of precipitation per year. But in some years, we only get 25 centimeters. That means that we farmers risk everything for the
harvest on an annual basis. But no matter how often Mother Nature tries to trip us up, we always get up again and
start afresh the following year. ‚Äú
As a result of the dry conditions, Reed and many of his
colleagues have decided against tilling in order to retain
as much moisture in the soil as possible. But that has one
major disadvantage, as Reed explains. ‚ÄúThe weeds spread
faster every year.‚Äù Reed is particularly worried about increasing herbicide resistance, particularly in the weed
species ‚Äúkochia‚Äù (burningbush). This weed competes with
wheat plants for light, nutrients and moisture, and can
have a dramatic impact on harvests. ‚ÄúWhat we urgently
need is a greater spectrum of new herbicides for the future to prevent resistances from developing so that existing herbicides will remain effective,‚Äù says Reed.
While climate and resistance problems have been
impacting the yields of wheat growers all over the world
since the 1990s, what is really urgently needed is bigger
harvests. ‚ÄúThe demand for staple foods will rise by
60 percent by 2050,‚Äù says Steve Patterson, Bayer Global
Crop Manager Cereals. ‚ÄúFor wheat, the major driver is the
growing world population, followed by the shifting diets
of the new middle classes in emerging countries.‚Äù

Production, however, is unable to keep up. In
addition, a recent study revealed that the wheat
harvest could decline by six percent with every
degree of climate warming. ‚ÄúTo close this gap
and safeguard the wheat supply, we need a
technological breakthrough in wheat research,‚Äù
says Patterson. Miracles should not be expected
though. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never going to be able to grow
wheat in the Sahara and we can‚Äôt bring withered
plants back to life. But we can help to compensate
for drought-related harvest losses. We can help
the plants to perform better in key phases of
drought and heat stress.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need a technological
breakthrough in wheat
research.‚Äù
Steve Patterson, Bayer Global Crop Manager Cereals

Scientists are looking for chemical innovations to
serve as a protective shield to plants in emergency
situations. Meanwhile, researchers are also working on developing wheat varieties with greater vitality and enhanced heat tolerance. To adapt wheat
varieties to the respective climate conditions,
Bayer‚Äôs breeding work is carried out all over the
world with locally adapted varieties being bred for
greater environmental tolerance and robustness at
breeding stations in Canada, Belgium, Germany,
France, Ukraine, Australia and the United States.
The breakthrough is expected to arrive after 2023.
For wheat farmer Reed, this is a perspective that
offers him hope. ‚ÄúTo achieve this quantum leap in
global nutrition, we need companies and organizations that can see the big picture, or we will never
solve the problem.‚Äù

says Frederic Baur, head of Vector Control at Bayer. ‚ÄúThe
carrier of the disease, the tiger or Aedes mosquito, lives
and breeds in the innumerable water reservoirs, both
large and small, found in cities. Rising urbanization and
possibly climate change are creating increasingly favorable habitat conditions for the mosquito.‚Äù Dengue fever is
currently endemic in more than 100 countries and is continuing to spread. The disease can be curbed effectively by
combating its vector.
Bayer can help protect those at risk with larvicides to control mosquito larvae in water reservoirs and insecticide
sprays to impregnate surfaces in residential buildings and
on roadways. Bayer active ingredients for mosquito sprays
also provide personal protection against bites. To prevent
or break resistances to existing active ingredients, Bayer
is also involved in several global research projects on new
mechanisms of action. The company has considerably
increased its overall investment in research into dengue
fever in recent years. A new spray for treating building
facades and municipal parks is now in the advanced
stages of development. It is expected to be available by
2018 and promises an extended duration of action thanks
to its resistance to rain and uv radiation.

About this Report

About this Report

This integrated Annual Report combines our financial and
our sustainability reporting. Our aim is to elucidate the
interactions between financial, ecological and societal
factors and underline their influence on our company‚Äôs
long-term development, thus providing our stakeholders
with comprehensive and transparent information.
We are reporting on fiscal 2015 and thus refer to the
organizational structure that was in place until December
31, 2015. Exceptions are those chapters in the Management Report which discuss forward-looking issues ‚Äì strategy, targets and key performance indicators ‚Äì as well as
the Report on Future Perspectives and on Opportunities
and Risks. These are aligned to the organizational structure as of January 1, 2016, which is described in Chapter
1.2 ‚ÄúCorporate Structure.‚Äù
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group
as of December 31, 2015, comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs) valid at the closing date
and with the provisions of the German Commercial Code in
conjunction with German financial reporting standards.
The combined management report complies with these requirements and provides an overview of the financial position and results of operations of the Bayer Group.
The Compensation Report for the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board complies with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The
consolidated financial statements and the combined man-

agement report are published in line with statutory disclosure requirements.
The Bayer Group‚Äôs sustainability reporting is aligned to
the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (gri) and
the 10 principles of the u.n. Global Compact (ungc). In
fiscal 2015, we applied the gri G4 Guidelines in compliance with the ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù option for the first time.
The detailed gri content index with the corresponding
ungc principles can be found in the ‚ÄúFurther Information‚Äù
section in the augmented version of the Annual Report.
Online only, we also publish a separate pdf file with a
summary of the u.n. Global Compact Progress Report
based on the criteria of the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership.

gri
G4-23

Our reporting is also aligned to international guidelines
and recommendations, including those on the definition
and selection of nonfinancial indicators and on reporting
such as those of the oecd and the iso 26000 standards.
In selecting and measuring our key data we also take into
account the recommendations of the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies (effas) in the case of
nonfinancial indicators, and those of the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol regarding greenhouse gas emissions. We also
consider the recommendations of the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (wbcsd) and the
European Chemical Industry Council (cefic). This year we
will again submit a declaration of conformity with the
German Sustainability Code.

Data collection and reporting thresholds
gri

We collected the data of all relevant organizational units
and companies worldwide that fell within the scope of
the Bayer Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015.

occupational injuries, transport accidents and environmental incidents are collected at all sites worldwide.
Environmentally relevant indicators are measured at all
production sites.

We mainly use sap systems to collect financial data
worldwide. We use the global sap hr information system
and the associated reporting application ‚Äì the Sustainability Management Annual Reporting Tool (smart) ‚Äì to
collect hr indicators and social data. All hse (health,
safety and environmental protection) performance indicators for the Group are collated in our Group-wide site
information system (BaySIS). The hse data cover all fully
consolidated companies in which Bayer owns at least
50% of the shares. The performance indicators of these
companies are fully consolidated, irrespective of the
exact proportion of the shares held by Bayer. Data on

In accordance with ifrs 5 (Non-current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations), financial indicators are given for continuing operations unless otherwise
explicitly indicated. The same applies to hr indicators
and our social data. In the case of hse indicators, the
value shown is the total for the Bayer Group; no distinction is made between continuing and discontinued
operations.

Report of the Supervisory Board

Report of the Supervisory Board

During 2015, the Supervisory Board monitored the conduct of the company‚Äôs business by the Board
of Management on a regular basis with the aid of detailed written and oral reports received from the
Board of Management, and also acted in an advisory capacity. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Board of Management maintained a constant exchange of information. In this way the Supervisory Board was kept continuously informed about the company‚Äôs
intended business strategy, corporate planning (including financial, investment and human resources
planning), earnings performance, the state of the business and the situation in the company and the
Group as a whole.
Where Board of Management decisions or actions required the approval of the Supervisory Board,
whether by law or under the Articles of Incorporation or the rules of procedure, the draft resolutions
were inspected by the members at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board, sometimes after preparatory work by the committees, or approved on the basis of documents circulated to the members. The
Supervisory Board was involved in decisions of material importance to the company. We discussed at
length the business trends described in the reports from the Board of Management and the prospects
for the development of the Bayer Group as a whole, the individual organizational units and the principal
affiliated companies in Germany and abroad.
CHANGES ON THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
The Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Thomas de Win, stepped down effective June 30, 2015.
He was succeeded as a member of the Supervisory Board by Heinz Georg Webers, who had been elected as a substitute for de Win. The Supervisory Board elected Oliver Z√ºhlke as its new Vice Chairman.
Peter Hausmann stepped down from the Supervisory Board effective October 31, 2015. The Local Court
of Cologne appointed Frank L√∂llgen as his successor.
In connection with Bayer's focus on the Life Science business and the reorganization of the Bayer
Group, the Board of Management was expanded to include the heads of the new divisions. The Supervisory Board therefore appointed Dieter Weinand (Pharmaceuticals), Erica Mann (Consumer Health)
and Liam Condon (Crop Science) to the Board of Management effective January 1, 2016. Also with
effect from January 1, 2016, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Hartmut Klusik as new Labor Director
with responsibility for Human Resources, Technology and Sustainability on the Board of Management
of Bayer AG. He succeeds Michael K√∂nig, who had requested that his contract not be extended.
WORK OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Six meetings of the full Supervisory Board took place during 2015. No member of the Supervisory
Board attended only half or fewer than half of its meetings or those of the committees on which he / she
served. The average attendance rate by Supervisory Board members at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and of its committees held in 2015 was approximately 97 percent.
The members of the Board of Management regularly attended the meetings of the Supervisory Board.

Report of the Supervisory Board

Werner Wenning, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG

The deliberations of the Supervisory Board focused on questions relating to Bayer‚Äôs strategy, portfolio
and business activities, as well as personnel decisions. The discussions at the respective meetings in
2015 centered on various topics. At the February meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed the 2014
Annual Report and the agenda for the 2015 Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting. It also dealt with the Bayer
Group‚Äôs risk management system, matters relating to the Board of Management's compensation and the
results of the efficiency audit of the Supervisory Board.
At the May meeting, the Supervisory Board dealt with the planned sale of the Diabetes Care business
and discussed the business performance to date in 2015 and the imminent Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting. At an extraordinary meeting in August, the Supervisory Board discussed in detail the stock market
flotation of Bayer‚Äôs MaterialScience unit under the name Covestro.
At the September meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed Bayer‚Äôs strategy and the future organization of the Bayer Group effective January 1, 2016. With effect from January 1, 2016, the Supervisory
Board appointed four new members to the Board of Management ‚Äì Erica Mann, Dieter Weinand, Liam
Condon and Hartmut Klusik ‚Äì and approved the departure of Michael K√∂nig from the Board of Management. In connection with the new appointments, the Supervisory Board also discussed in detail
matters related to the Board of Management‚Äôs compensation. In addition, the Supervisory Board once
again discussed the planned stock market flotation of Covestro against the background of the market
environment at that time. Finally, the Supervisory Board resolved upon changes to the rules of procedure of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and established an additional Supervisory
Board committee, the Innovation Committee.
At an extraordinary meeting in October, the Supervisory Board again discussed the stock market flotation of Covestro and resolved upon the volume of the flotation and the issue price range. At its meeting
in December 2015, the Supervisory Board undertook the routine review of the pension amounts of the

36

Report of the Supervisory Board

former members of the Board of Management. Also at this meeting, the Board of Management presented its planning for the business operations in the years 2016 through 2018 and provided information
on the current rating situation. The Supervisory Board also approved the proposed financing framework
for 2016. In addition, the Supervisory Board once again dealt with the company‚Äôs strategy, including
developments in the crop science industry, and with the collaboration between Bayer and crispr Therapeutics. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board resolved to designate Deloitte & Touche GmbH
Wirtschaftspr√ºfungsgesellschaft as its first choice with regard to the bidding process for the audit of the
financial statements for the years 2017 through 2021. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to
issue an unqualified declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. Following
the meeting, an information and discussion forum took place on the topic of Life Sciences.
COMMITTEES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board has a Presidial Committee, an Audit Committee, a Human Resources Committee,
a Nominations Committee and an Innovation Committee. The current membership of the committees is
shown in the ‚ÄúFurther Information‚Äù section under ‚ÄúGovernance Bodies.‚Äù
The meetings and decisions of the committees, and especially the meetings of the Audit Committee,
were prepared on the basis of reports and other information provided by the Board of Management.
Reports on the committee meetings were presented at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board.
Presidial Committee: This comprises the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board along
with a further stockholder representative and a further employee representative. The Presidial Committee serves primarily as the mediation committee pursuant to the German Codetermination Act. It has the
task of submitting proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of
Management if the necessary two-thirds majority is not achieved in the first vote at a plenary meeting.
Certain decision-making powers in connection with capital measures, including the power to amend the
Articles of Incorporation accordingly, have also been delegated to this committee. The Presidial Committee may also undertake preparatory work for full meetings of the Supervisory Board.
In 2015, the Presidial Committee was not required to convene in its capacity as the mediation committee. Based on the corresponding authorization by the Supervisory Board, it resolved in writing in 2015
on the issue and redemption of hybrid bonds. At a meeting in September, the Presidial Committee discussed in detail the planned stock market flotation of Covestro and submitted a proposal to the Supervisory Board concerning the volume of the flotation and the issue price range.
Audit Committee: The Audit Committee comprises three stockholder representatives and three employee representatives. The Chairman of the Audit Committee in 2015, Dr. Klaus Sturany, satisfies the
statutory requirements concerning the independence and the expertise in the field of accounting or
auditing that a member of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee is required to possess. The
Audit Committee meets regularly four times a year.
Its tasks include in particular oversight of the financial reporting process, the effectiveness and ongoing
development of the internal control system, the risk management system, the internal audit system, the
compliance system and the audit of the financial statements. The Audit Committee prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board concerning the financial statements and management report of Bayer AG
and the proposal for the use of the distributable profit, the consolidated financial statements and management report of the Bayer Group and the agreements with the auditor (particularly the awarding of
the audit contract, the determination of the main areas of focus for the audit and the audit fee agreement). The committee submits a proposal to the full Supervisory Board concerning the auditor‚Äôs appointment, and takes appropriate measures to determine and monitor the auditor's independence. The
audit focuses particularly on whether the financial statements have been prepared in compliance with
the statutory requirements and whether the financial reporting provides a true and fair view of the
financial position and results of operations of the company and the Group.
The Audit Committee discusses developments in the area of corporate compliance at each of its meetings where necessary.

Report of the Supervisory Board

The Chairman of the Board of Management and the Chief Financial Officer regularly attended the meetings of the Audit Committee. Representatives of the auditor were also present at all the meetings and
reported in detail on the audit work and the audit reviews of the interim financial reports.
The meetings focused on a number of topics. At the February meeting, the Audit Committee discussed
the financial statements and the Group‚Äôs tax strategy and tax risks. It also carefully considered the risk
report, which covered the risk management system, planning and market risks, legal risks, corporate
compliance, the report on process and organizational risks and the internal control system, and the
report by the Internal Audit department. At this meeting, the Audit Committee also made a recommendation to the full Supervisory Board concerning the resolution to be submitted to the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on the appointment of the auditor of the financial statements.
The April meeting mainly dealt with the yearly report of the Group Compliance Officer, the determination of the main areas of focus for the audit of the 2015 financial statements and the bidding process for
the audit of the financial statements for 2017 and the fiscal years thereafter. At its July meeting, the
Audit Committee again addressed the bidding process for the audit of the financial statements. As at
every meeting, the quarterly financial statements were also discussed, along with legal and compliance
issues. At its meeting in October, the Audit Committee once more discussed the bidding process for the
audit of the financial statements in addition to the regular items on the agenda.
Human Resources Committee: On this committee, too, there is parity of representation between stockholders and employees. It consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other members.
The Human Resources Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory Board, which
resolves on appointments or dismissals of members of the Board of Management. The Human Resources Committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board on the service contracts of the members
of the Board of Management. However, it is the task of the full Supervisory Board to resolve on the total
compensation of the individual members of the Board of Management and the respective compensation
components, as well as to regularly review the compensation system on the basis of recommendations
submitted by the Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources Committee also discusses the
long-term succession planning for the Board of Management.
The Human Resources Committee convened on two occasions in 2015. The matters discussed at these
meetings concerned the compensation and contracts of the members of the Board of Management and
the preparation of the appointment of the new members of the Board of Management.
Nominations Committee: This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held. It suggests suitable candidates for the
Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting for election. The Nominations
Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the other stockholder representative
on the Presidial Committee.
On several occasions outside of the meetings in 2015, the members of the Nominations Committee
discussed candidates for the elections to the Supervisory Board that are due to take place in 2016, along
with the medium-term planning for the composition of the stockholder side of the Supervisory Board.
Innovation Committee: The Innovation Committee was established in September 2015. It is primarily
concerned with the innovation strategy and innovation management, the strategy for the protection of
intellectual property, and major research and development programs at Bayer. It is also responsible for
advising and overseeing the management and preparing any Supervisory Board decisions. The Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and five other members, with parity of representation between stockholder and employee representatives. The Chairman of the Board of Management
and the member of the Board of Management responsible for Innovation regularly attend the meetings
of the Innovation Committee.
In 2015, the Innovation Committee convened once in December and dealt at this meeting with new
technologies in the area of Life Sciences.

Report of the Supervisory Board

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Supervisory Board dealt with the ongoing development of corporate governance at Bayer, partly
through the amendment of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, taking into account the May
5, 2015, version of the German Corporate Governance Code. In December, the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board issued a new declaration concerning the German Corporate Governance
Code.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITS
The financial statements of Bayer AG were prepared according to the requirements of the German
Commercial Code and Stock Corporation Act. The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group
were prepared according to the German Commercial Code and the International Financial Reporting
Standards (ifrs). The combined management report was prepared according to the German Commercial Code. The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft, Wirtschaftspr√ºfungsgesellschaft,
Essen, has audited the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the
Bayer Group and the combined management report. The conduct of the audit is explained in the auditor‚Äôs reports. The auditor finds that Bayer has complied, as appropriate, with the German Commercial
Code, the German Stock Corporation Act and / or the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union, and issues an unqualified opinion on the financial statements of Bayer
AG and the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group. The financial statements of Bayer AG,
the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group, the combined management report and the
audit reports were submitted to all members of the Supervisory Board. They were discussed in detail by
the Audit Committee and at a meeting of the full Supervisory Board. The auditor submitted a report on
both occasions and was present during the discussions.
We examined the financial statements of Bayer AG, the proposal for the use of the distributable profit,
the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report. We
have no objections, thus we concur with the result of the audit.
We have approved the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated financial statements of the
Bayer Group prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements of Bayer AG are thus
confirmed. We are in agreement with the combined management report and, in particular, with the
assessment of the future development of the enterprise. We also concur with the dividend policy and the
decisions concerning earnings retention by the company. We assent to the proposal for the use of the
distributable profit, which provides for payment of a dividend of ‚Ç¨2.50 per share.
The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Board of Management and all employees for their dedication and hard work in 2015.

Investor Information

The Stock Market in 2015
STOCK MARKETS END THE YEAR WITH GAINS FOLLOWING EXTREME FLUCTUATIONS
Fiscal 2015 was characterized worldwide by high volatility. The program to purchase certain bonds
announced by the European Central Bank in the spring stimulated optimism and increasing share
prices. As the year progressed, however, the investment climate was dampened by speculation as to
Greece‚Äôs exit from the eurozone, economic concerns in China and the decline in the global oil price.
Additionally, the capital market environment was influenced by the Fed rate increase in the United
States at the end of 2015.
The dax reached its high for the year in the second quarter of 2015, closing at 12,375 points on April
10. This was also an all-time record for the index. From that time until September, the dax dropped
almost 3,000 points to 9,428 points in a development characterized by strong fluctuations. In the closing
months of the year, the index recovered to close at 10,743 points for a year-on-year gain of 9.6 percent.
The European equities index euro stoxx 50 (performance index) rose 6.4 percent, ending the year at
6,226 points. Share prices in the United States and Japan varied in their performance. The s&p 500
index was largely unchanged, while the Nikkei 225 increased by around 9 percent.
BAYER STOCK YIELDS FOUR PERCENT FOR THE YEAR
Including the dividend of ‚Ç¨2.25 per share paid at the end of May, the return on Bayer stock was
4.2 percent in 2015. Bayer stock ended the year at ‚Ç¨115.80, having reached a high for the year and an
all-time high of ‚Ç¨146.20 in April.
Following a period of significantly above-average value creation from 2012 to 2014, the yield of Bayer
stock in 2015 was below that of the reference indices, with the exception of the euro stoxx Chemicals
Index (performance index). The euro stoxx Chemicals Index (performance index) climbed by
3.6 percent in 2015, while the euro stoxx Health Care Index (performance index) rose by 19.2 percent.
More than 90 percent of the roughly 30 equity analysts who regularly rate our company had a buy or
hold recommendation on our stock at the end of last year.

GOOD FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BAYER IN VOLATILE MARKETS
The environment for corporate bonds remained favorable in 2015 ‚Äì a year that, however, was marked by
sharp fluctuations in the interest markets and a trend toward increased borrowing cost mark-ups. Particularly stark mark-ups were observed for the interest rate level, which saw its long-term downward
trend cease at the end of the first quarter of 2015. The subsequent volatility occurred at a historically
low absolute interest rate level. Against this background, investors sought medium- to long-term maturities. Interest in subordinated bonds remained high, even though investors increasingly demanded higher new issue premiums as the year progressed.
The development of risk premiums is apparent from the trend in credit default swaps (cds) shown in
Graphic 2.2. On the derivatives market, the price of these tradable insurance contracts, which are used
to hedge against default of a borrower, shows how a company‚Äôs credit standing is rated. The graphic
shows the trend toward higher borrowing cost mark-ups and considerable volatility over the course of
the year.
Benefiting from the still very positive market environment at the end of the first quarter, Bayer issued a
hybrid bond with a volume of ‚Ç¨1.3 billion and a coupon of 2.375 percent. Further details of outstanding
bonds are given in Note [27] to the consolidated financial statements.

LONG-TERM RETURN ON BAYER STOCK STILL AHEAD OF THE MARKET
A long-term investor who purchased Bayer shares for ‚Ç¨10,000 five years ago and reinvested all dividends would have seen the value of the position grow to ‚Ç¨23,545 as of December 31, 2015, giving
an average annual return of 18.7 percent. That was well above the return on the dax and the euro
stoxx 50 (performance index) in the same period. Bayer stock also outperformed these indices on a
three-year view.

DIVIDEND INCREASE TO ‚Ç¨2.50 PER SHARE
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Stockholders‚Äô
Meeting that the dividend be increased by ‚Ç¨0.25 to ‚Ç¨2.50 per share. Thus we once again intend that our
stockholders should participate in last year‚Äôs positive business performance. The resulting payout ratio
of 37 percent calculated on core earnings per share is within our target corridor of 30 percent to
40 percent (for details of the calculation of core earnings per share, see Chapter 14.3 of the Combined
Management Report).
The dividend yield calculated on the share price of ‚Ç¨115.80 at year end 2015 amounts to 2.2 percent
and the total dividend payment to ‚Ç¨2,067 million.

A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT
We continued our dialogue with sustainability-oriented investors, analysts and rating agencies in 2015.
In numerous conversations, we explained our strategy and the implementation of our nonfinancial
targets, and provided information on the most important fields of our sustainability activity. This direct
contact serves as the basis for transparent and fair evaluation.
In 2015, Bayer again qualified for inclusion in major sustainability indices that assess companies according to environmental, social and governance criteria: Dow Jones Sustainability World, ftse4Good
(Europe, Global and Environmental Leaders Europe 40), msci Low Carbon Target, nyse Euronext Low
Carbon 100 Europe, stoxx¬Æ Global esg Leaders and Access to Medicine Index.
INTERNATIONAL OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
The number of Bayer stockholders rose substantially in 2015. At the end of 2015, approximately
300,000 stockholders were listed in our share register ‚Äì an increase of about 33,000 compared with the
previous year. Our ownership structure shows the international distribution of our capital stock. The
highest proportion of our outstanding shares, almost 28 percent, is held by investors in the United
States and Canada, followed by Germany with nearly 21 percent. From a regional perspective, Bayer has
a stable ownership structure that has altered only slightly in recent years. Bayer has a 100 percent free
float as defined by Deutsche B√∂rse, the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

INVESTOR RELATIONS FOCUSED ON THE COVESTRO STOCK MARKET FLOTATION
Bayer‚Äôs investor relations (ir) activities last year were dominated by the focus on the Life Science businesses, and thus by the stock market flotation announced in 2014 of our former Bayer MaterialScience
subgroup. Under the new name Covestro AG, these activities were successfully listed on the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange at the beginning of October by way of an ipo (initial public offering). We handled many
questions particularly from private investors in the period prior and subsequent to the listing.
Bayer‚Äôs management and the ir team last year spent nearly 60 days communicating directly with analysts and investors during roadshows and investor conferences.
Our Meet Management conferences in Berlin and New York gave investors and analysts an opportunity
for direct dialogue with Bayer‚Äôs top management.
As in previous years, private investors also had an opportunity to find out about our company at various
stockholder forums at which the Investor Relations team was present.
We received awards for our ir work again in 2015. In the Thomson Reuters Extel Survey 2015, investors and analysts named Bayer the company with the best investor relations work in the chemicals
sector. We took third place in the same category in the Pan European Survey. We were also ranked
second among dax 30 companies in a report by the German Investor Relations Association (dirk) and
the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche.

1.1 Corporate Profile
Bayer is a Life Science company with a more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas
of health care and agriculture. With our innovative products, we are contributing to finding solutions to
some of the major challenges of our time. The growing and increasingly aging world population requires improved medical care and an adequate supply of food. Bayer is improving people‚Äôs quality of
life by preventing, alleviating and treating diseases. And we are helping to provide a reliable supply of
high-quality food, feed and plant-based raw materials.
We develop new molecules for use in innovative products and solutions to improve the health of humans, animals and plants. Our research and development activities are based on a profound understanding of the biochemical processes in living organisms.
Our goal is to achieve and sustain leadership positions in our markets, thus creating value for our customers, stockholders and employees. To this end, our strategy is designed to help solve some of the
most pressing challenges facing humankind, and by doing this exceptionally well we aim to strengthen
the company‚Äôs earning power.
We are committed to operating sustainably and addressing our social and ethical responsibilities as a
corporate citizen, while at the same time respecting the interests of all our stakeholders. Employees
with a passion for innovation enjoy excellent development opportunities at Bayer.
All this goes to make up our mission ‚Äì Bayer: Science For A Better Life.
EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON THE LIFE SCIENCE BUSINESSES
Following the economic and legal independence of our former MaterialScience subgroup, now
Covestro, Bayer has charted the course for its successful development as a Life Science company. Our
businesses hold leading positions in innovation-driven growth markets. Together they make up a strong,
attractive and balanced portfolio that is resistant to fluctuations in demand and to potential risks. The
previous structure ‚Äì comprising a strategic management holding company and operational subgroups ‚Äì
has thus been replaced by an integrated organization under the umbrella of the strong Bayer brand.
The chapters in this report dealing with corporate strategy and future perspectives are based on the
new structure because they look ahead. All other chapters reflect the organizational structure in effect
through December 31, 2015.
OUR VALUES
Bayer‚Äôs values play a central role in our daily work and are intended to guide us in fulfilling our mission
‚ÄúBayer: Science For A Better Life.‚Äù They are represented by the acronym life, which stands for Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency.
These values apply to everyone at Bayer and are firmly integrated into our global performance management system for managerial employees. Our value culture ensures a common identity throughout
the enterprise across national boundaries, management hierarchies and cultural differences.

1.2 Corporate Structure
CORPORATE STRUCTURE IN 2015
Until December 31, 2015, Bayer AG, headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, served as a strategic
management holding company, defining common values, goals and strategies for the entire Bayer
Group. It was also responsible for resource allocation and managerial appointments. Under its direction,
the three subgroups ‚Äì HealthCare, CropScience and Covestro (formerly MaterialScience) ‚Äì conducted
their business operations on their own responsibility in line with predefined goals, supported by three
service companies. Following the signing of a sales agreement with Panasonic Healthcare Holdings,
Ltd. on June 8, 2015, the Diabetes Care business is no longer reported under continuing operations.

NEW CORPORATE STRUCTURE EFFECTIVE 2016
With the company‚Äôs focus now on the Life Science businesses, a new organizational structure was
introduced effective January 1, 2016. The company‚Äôs operations are now managed in three divisions ‚Äì
Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science ‚Äì and the Animal Health business unit. The former Bayer HealthCare subgroup has been dissolved. The Radiology and Pharmaceuticals businesses
have been merged to form the Pharmaceuticals Division. The Consumer Health Division now consists
entirely of the consumer care business. Animal Health has become a separate reporting segment. The
Bayer CropScience subgroup is now the Crop Science Division. The former MaterialScience subgroup,
renamed Covestro, became legally and economically independent on September 1, 2015. Covestro AG
was floated on the stock market on October 6, 2015. Bayer currently still owns around 69% of
Covestro AG. Covestro therefore remains a reporting segment of the Bayer Group because Bayer AG
continues to exercise control.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Board of Management of Bayer AG was enlarged to include the heads of
the new Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science divisions. The business continues to be
supported by Business Services and Currenta, while Technology Services is being integrated into
Bayer AG, forming the Engineering & Technology function.

1.3 Group Strategy
Our mission ‚ÄúBayer: Science For A Better Life‚Äù continues to guide our endeavors. The steadily growing
and aging global population needs new and better medicines and an adequate food supply. With our
Life Science innovations, we offer answers to these challenges.

OUR OBJECTIVE: PROFITABLE GROWTH
Our corporate strategy is aligned toward profitable growth that will increase the company‚Äôs value in the
long term. As well as expanding in growth markets, we attach special importance to the development of
new products that create significant value for our stakeholders.

THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR SUCCESS: INNOVATION
Science-based innovations have made us the globally successful company we are today. Going forward,
we will continue to strengthen this important foundation for our success. In 2016 alone, we plan to
invest around ‚Ç¨4.5 billion in research and development ‚Äì more than ever before. Our scientists will
continue to collaborate across divisional boundaries, supported in part by the new Bayer Life Science
Center, which has been created to identify innovative technologies developed by startups and universities and make them available for our fields of activity. We are also driving forward new business models
that include utilizing the opportunities offered by digitization for our company and our customers.

A FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE: SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainable business practices are essential to our company‚Äôs future viability. We apply our scientific
expertise and innovation strength to help solve global challenges. Our goal in developing, manufacturing and marketing our products is to balance commercial success with societal and ecological requirements while increasing enterprise value. We aim to ensure broad social acceptance for our business
through responsible practices in areas such as product stewardship, environmental protection, safety,
compliance, supplier management and human resources policy, taking into account the expectations of
relevant stakeholders.

OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE: THE EMPLOYEES
Our employees are the key to our company‚Äôs success. We therefore create a working environment in
which each employee can unfold his or her full potential, drive forward innovations and achieve performance excellence. Our objective as an employer is to partner an employee throughout his or her career
and not just at a certain phase. We live up to this aspiration with flexible worktime models, a firm commitment to social responsibility and the provision of wide-ranging development opportunities across the
company. A diverse employee structure is also vital for our company‚Äôs future competitiveness. We therefore strive for a good cultural and gender balance in all areas.

1.4 Targets and Performance Indicators
To consistently implement our strategy, we have set ambitious targets for our company and measure
their attainment annually in terms of selected performance indicators. This program encompasses not
only financial targets and innovation goals, but also sustainability objectives that are aligned to important areas along the value chain. Our aim is to make clear the challenges we have identified in our
core business in the context of sustainable development, and at the same time to highlight the continuous improvements we are committed to making across the enterprise.
Following the legal independence and stock market flotation of Covestro, this company is not included
in the new innovation, sustainability and employee targets. Where necessary, we have adjusted the
reference data for unchanged targets to eliminate the contributions for Covestro.
The current status of our progress in respect of our targets and performance indicators is documented
in the following table and the respective chapters.

See Chapter 18

1.5 Internal Management System
The economic planning and steering for the business units is carried out within a framework laid down
by the Board of Management that is refined during the strategic planning process. Operational planning
then translates this framework into specific, measurable targets. Continuous monitoring of business
developments complements the planning and management process, and key management and performance indicators are regularly updated. This process also involves tracking the implementation of the
strategic objectives and adopting countermeasures in the event of deviations from the budget.
One of the prime objectives of the Bayer Group is to steadily increase enterprise value. We use the
following steering parameters to plan, steer and monitor the development of our business.
The key performance indicators at the strategic level are cash value added (cva), which is a value-based
steering parameter, and cash flow return on investment (cfroi). These indicators support management
in its decision-making, especially in the areas of strategic portfolio optimization and the allocation
of resources for acquisitions and capital expenditures. In fiscal 2015, Bayer achieved a positive cva of
‚Ç¨1,285 million and a cfroi of 9.6%. (See Chapter 14.4 ‚ÄúValue Management‚Äù for further details.)

See Chapter 14.4

The principal economic steering parameters within the Bayer Group at the operational level are sales
and earnings figures. With regard to earnings, special attention is paid to ebitda (ebit plus the amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, plus impairment
losses and minus impairment loss reversals, recognized in profit or loss during the reporting period)
before special items. The ebitda margin before special items, which is the ratio of ebitda before special
items to sales, serves as a relative indicator for the internal and external comparison of operational
earning power. In 2015, ebitda before special items amounted to ‚Ç¨10,266 million, resulting in an ebitda
margin before special items of 22.2%. (See Chapter 14.2 ‚ÄúCalculation of ebit(da) Before Special Items‚Äù
for further details.)

See Chapter 14.2

The Board of Management and the relevant committees steer the sustainable alignment of the company,
defining responsibilities and framework conditions by way of Group directives, for example. Operations
are steered using defined targets and performance indicators in areas such as innovation, supplier
management, safety, product stewardship and environmental protection. On the basis of a materiality
analysis, Bayer has determined the principal activities in these areas and established the relevant management systems, committees and working groups, which have been implemented by the subgroups.
The ongoing review and revision of guidelines and regular internal audits ensure that our management
systems are continuously improved and aligned to the specific requirements at any given time.

The value added statement shows Bayer‚Äôs direct contribution to public and private incomes and is a
measure of the direct financial value created for stakeholders by its business activities. We define value
added as the company‚Äôs total operating performance in the previous fiscal year less the costs of procured and consumed goods and services, depreciation and amortization.
The total operating performance of the Bayer Group in 2015 was ‚Ç¨47.8 billion. Value added amounted
to ‚Ç¨17.5 billion. Of the value added, ‚Ç¨11.2 billion (64%) was distributed to employees, ‚Ç¨2.1 billion
(12%) to stockholders, ‚Ç¨0.8 billion (4%) to lenders and ‚Ç¨1.5 billion (9%) to governments. The remainder was allocated to reserves.

1.7 Corporate Environment
Bayer‚Äôs business activities are impacted by economic and social conditions. At the same time, the
company contributes to shaping these conditions.
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
In 2015, the global economy grew at a slightly slower pace than in the previous year. Momentum
decreased in the emerging economies in particular; growth in China declined further but remained
strong while economic output in Russia and Brazil contracted significantly. By contrast, growth in the
European Union accelerated, supported by very low interest rates, an exchange rate favorable to the
eurozone and sinking oil prices. At the same time, the United States continued its robust recovery,
driven above all by private consumption and rising employment.

SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
Our economic activity is closely linked with the social environment. Certain stakeholders have become
increasingly significant to our business operations in recent years. Their expectations affect public
acceptance of Bayer and thus our commercial success. They provide important input for the continuing
development of our business processes, risk management and reporting. We therefore take the wideranging requirements of our stakeholders seriously and consider them wherever possible in our
business activities. At the same time, open dialogue with our stakeholders gives us an opportunity to
explain the value of our products and services for society. This is of growing importance for the success
of our business model.

PHARMACEUTICALS
At Pharmaceuticals, our largest division in terms of sales, we focus on researching, developing and
marketing innovative medicines with a positive cost-benefit ratio primarily in the therapeutic areas of
cardiology, oncology, gynecology, hematology and ophthalmology. In this way, we are addressing the
growing requirements of patients, physicians, health care payers and regulatory agencies.
As part of the Bayer Group‚Äôs reorganization, we have dissolved the Medical Care Division and integrated
the Radiology business unit into our Pharmaceuticals Division.
To achieve our medium-term growth targets, we are continuing to rely on marketing our recently
launched products Xarelto‚Ñ¢, Eylea‚Ñ¢, Stivarga‚Ñ¢, Xofigo‚Ñ¢ and Adempas‚Ñ¢. We plan to steadily expand
the indications for these medicines through comprehensive study programs ‚Äì some of them in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies ‚Äì and thus make them available to further patient groups.

59

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
2. Strategies of the Segments

To safeguard long-term growth, we will further increase our investment in research and development.
Besides expanding early research, we are concentrating on the clinical development of active drug
substance candidates in the therapeutic areas of cardiology, oncology, hematology and gynecology. In
addition, we are selectively expanding and supplementing our development portfolio through licensing
agreements and acquisitions.
To improve access to our products in developing and emerging countries (Access to Medicine), we
augment our philanthropic activities (see Chapter 11 for more information) with economically feasible
concepts.
online annex: 3-2-1:
As an innovation company, we aim to address current challenges in order to improve people‚Äôs quality
of life in the areas of disease prevention and therapy. Within the scope of our entrepreneurial possibilities in a dynamic market environment, we seek to make a responsible contribution for the benefit
of society. Through our Access to Medicine (atm) activities, we aim to enable access to our products
for certain patients, aligning these efforts to our company‚Äôs expertise and our specific product portfolio. Here we distinguish between not-for-profit and economically feasible activities. The former include our efforts in respect of neglected tropical diseases (ntds). In this connection, we provide the
who free of charge with two of our active ingredients to treat African sleeping sickness and Chagas
disease. Other activities in this area are our education programs and the development of products to
treat ntds.
Our family planning programs are economically feasible and facilitate improved access to hormonal
contraceptives for women in developing countries. These programs, which are anchored in our business strategy, provide international development partners with our products at preferential prices.
In some countries, where sections of the population have no access to innovative medicines via
health care systems, we have established patient assistance programs for selected products. These
aim particularly to provide access to oncology and cardiovascular products and products to treat
chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis and hemophilia. Such programs exist in, for example, the
United States and China as well as a number of countries in South and Southeast Asia and Southeastern Europe.
CONSUMER HEALTH
As part of the Bayer Group‚Äôs reorganization, the Consumer Care Division will be renamed Consumer
Health. The strategy of the new Consumer Health Division is aimed at building on our strong position in
the market for over-the-counter (otc) products, nutritional supplements and other self-care products in
selected consumer health categories.
We aim to strengthen our established brands, such as Aspirin‚Ñ¢, Aleve‚Ñ¢, Bepanthen‚Ñ¢, Berocca‚Ñ¢,
Canesten‚Ñ¢, Claritin‚Ñ¢, Coppertone‚Ñ¢, Dr. Scholl‚Äôs‚Ñ¢, Elevit‚Ñ¢, MiraLAX‚Ñ¢ and Supradyn‚Ñ¢, by driving
organic growth through product innovation and geographical expansion. We are also seeking to expand
our position in important markets such as the United States, Brazil, Russia and China.
Alongside the ongoing integration of the consumer care businesses acquired in 2014 from Merck & Co.,
Inc., United States, and Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., China, we continue to pursue external
growth opportunities arising from the progressive global consolidation of the otc industry. In this way,
we aim to further expand in selected categories and markets where it makes strategic sense to do so
and can contribute to increasing Bayer‚Äôs enterprise value.

CROP SCIENCE
We are aligning our Crop Science business to the long-term trends of the agricultural markets, from
which we have derived three focuses for our strategy:
‚Ä¢ Improvement in agricultural sustainability ‚Äì in other words the most responsible possible deployment of our resources
‚Ä¢ Increase in agricultural productivity through innovation ‚Äì in other words higher crop yields and
quality
‚Ä¢ Full leveraging of digitization opportunities to help farmers make the right decisions and to make
product applications even safer
Our aim is to help shape the future of the agricultural industry with innovative offerings that increase its
productivity, thus generating profitable and sustainable growth for Crop Science and our customers and
enabling the production of sufficient food, animal feed and renewable raw materials for a growing world
population despite the limited amount of available arable land. Crop Science‚Äôs strategy is built on four
key elements:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Enhancing the Crop Protection and Environmental Science portfolio
Expanding the Seeds business
Increasing customer centricity along the entire value chain
Leading the way in innovation

We aim to enhance our Crop Protection and Environmental Science portfolios by adding new and improved products, concentrating on core brands and offering integrated solutions in major crops. Support for this endeavor is provided by our innovative technology platform for both chemical and biological crop protection. We are continuously investing in the expansion of our production capacities to meet
rising demand for our products.
We continue to work on the expansion of our Seeds business. We plan to further strengthen our positions in our established crops ‚Äì cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice and vegetables ‚Äì and to establish competitive positions in soybeans and wheat. We intend to gain long-term access to high-quality breeding
material through acquisitions, in-licensing and partnerships and to steadily expand our existing breeding expertise.
Another major part of our strategy is to strengthen customer centricity along the entire value chain and
continuously optimize distribution. We are steadily expanding our successful food chain partnerships.
In these projects, Crop Science works with all participants in the food chain to safeguard and increase
yields, and to improve the quality of harvested produce. With the Bayer Forward Farming initiative,
Crop Science cooperates with farmers to demonstrate innovative crop solutions and services for sustainable agriculture to interested stakeholders. Crop Science will also increasingly concentrate on developing solutions especially tailored to help smallholder farmers increase their profitability while ensuring environmentally friendly cultivation, thus lastingly improving their standard of living.
To lead the way in innovation and develop holistic solutions, we aim to build on our expertise in the
integration of seed technology with chemical and biological crop protection and to support our customers with new and improved solutions. New areas of innovation, such as digitization in agriculture, account for another major part of this. We intend to support this development in the future by making use
of proprietary digital platforms and data models that can enable us to give farmers special agronomic
recommendations. The aim here is to make agriculture more sustainable.

ANIMAL HEALTH
Our Animal Health business aims to strengthen its position in the already heavily consolidated market
for veterinary medicines. Here we rely on organic growth through the expansion of our r&d activities
and the increased use of our existing distribution channels, particularly specialist retail chains. We also
intend to strengthen our position with targeted in-licensing and acquisitions.
COVESTRO
As a global supplier of high-tech polymer materials and application solutions for many areas of modern
life, Covestro aims to generate profitable growth in the long term. Over the coming five years, the company aims to build on its leading positions in its industry sectors and participate in the growth that
experts are predicting for its customer industries. Covestro supplies key industry sectors worldwide
such as the automotive, construction and electronics industries. It develops and manufactures components for polyurethane foams, the high-tech plastic polycarbonate and raw materials for coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as specialty products such as films and elastomers.
Growth impetus is expected to come from macro trends such as climate change, the diminishing availability of fossil resources, the expanding global population, urbanization and increasing mobility.
Through its products, Covestro aims to help master these challenges in line with its vision ‚ÄúTo make the
world a brighter place.‚Äù In keeping with this, the company‚Äôs activities are embedded in a comprehensive sustainability strategy.
Covestro‚Äôs large-scale facilities around the world have been extended and are capable of serving the
anticipated growth in demand. Therefore, the company does not predict any greater need for expansion
in the foreseeable future.
At the same time, Covestro intends to further optimize its network of sites and its cost structures. To this
end, the company has initiated a structured profitability program.
Covestro is focusing on continuous product and process innovation as a means of safeguarding and
building its competitive position in the global marketplace. Research and development is steered by
targets aligned to the needs of the company‚Äôs customer industries.
The Polyurethanes (pur) business unit intends to further expand its strong position as an integrated
raw material and systems supplier, mainly for rigid and flexible foams. While flexible foam ensures
added comfort in everyday life through its use in products such as mattresses and upholstery, rigid foam
serves above all as an insulating material for buildings and refrigerated appliances, and thus helps to
lower energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
In the automotive, electronics and construction sectors, in particular, rising demand is anticipated for
polycarbonate, an engineering thermoplastic characterized by positive properties such as low weight,
transparency, stability and design flexibility. The Polycarbonates (pcs) business unit aims to further
strengthen its technological leadership and is focusing on, for example, polycarbonate-based composite
materials as a low-cost substitute for solutions based on glass and metal.
The Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (cas) business unit develops and manufactures mainly polyurethane-based raw materials primarily for coatings and adhesives. The main areas of application are automotive and transportation, infrastructure and construction, wood processing and furniture. The business unit aims to secure and build its position in its core business and to achieve accelerated growth in
specialties.

HEALTHCARE
Growth in the pharmaceuticals market in 2015 was flat with the prior year. In the United States in
particular, new products especially continued to drive ongoing growth. In Japan and Europe, growth
rates increased slightly, whereas demand in the emerging markets was unchanged against the previous
year.
The global consumer care market saw somewhat stronger growth than a year earlier. In the medical
care category, slight growth was seen in the market for contrast agents and medical equipment. The
animal health market expanded at the same rate as in the prior year.
CROPSCIENCE
Overall, the global seed and crop protection market receded in 2015. While the demand for high-value
seeds remained at the previous year‚Äôs level, worldwide crop protection sales declined.
Market volumes decreased in Latin America, particularly in Argentina and Brazil, primarily as a result of
political uncertainties, macroeconomic developments and lower pest pressure. The market also declined
in North America, mainly due to a reduction in corn and cotton acreages and because of lower overall
price levels for agricultural commodities than in the previous year. Positive growth impetus for the seed
and crop protection market in 2015 came from the Asia / Pacific and Europe regions. Growth rates in the
Mediterranean area were above average.
COVESTRO
Growth in the principal customer industries for Covestro (automotive, construction, electrical / electronics and furniture) in 2015 was slightly weaker than in the previous year. One of the main reasons for this
was slower demand in China and other emerging economies, which could not be compensated by positive stimuli such as the expansionary monetary policy of the industrialized countries and the lower oil
price.

We augment our own research capacities through collaborations and strategic alliances with industrial
and academic research partners around the world. These include leading universities, public research
institutes, partner and start-up companies, and science and innovation centers established by Bayer to
give young companies access to features such as suitable laboratory and office infrastructure in the
direct vicinity of Bayer‚Äôs own research facilities. These are supplemented by our crowdsourcing platforms through which researchers around the world can offer their expertise for collaboration with
Bayer. With the newly established strategic innovation unit, the Bayer LifeScience Center (blsc), we
additionally want to drive the development of decisive interspecies research with the aid of a network of
external partnerships. On the initiative of blsc we signed an agreement at the end of 2015 with the
biotech company crispr Therapeutics AG based in Basel, Switzerland, with the goal of discovering,
developing and marketing new treatment methods for blood disorders, blindness and heart disease
based on the crispr-Cas9 technology for gene editing.
We also invest in venture capital funds that finance promising Life Science start-up companies, among
other projects. In this way we support the development of new therapies in areas with a high unmet
medical need and drive innovation in the Life Sciences.

Scientists from our company are involved in constant dialogue with renowned research institutes and
support partnership projects in the public and private sectors. Of these, more than 50 projects
worldwide were supported in 2015 by public funding worth around ‚Ç¨5 million. This is equivalent to
roughly 0.1% of our annual r&d expenses.
We also participate in industry associations, hold professorships at universities worldwide and regularly invite scientists, university students and schoolchildren to attend events such as symposiums on
health topics or research days for school students. We view this as an investment in the future, because as a research-based company, we rely on the availability of talented and highly trained people
and on society‚Äôs acceptance of technology.
We promote our innovation capability not just by increasing our research and development budget and
expanding external collaborations, but also by strengthening our internal innovation culture, which
promotes fascination, creativity, willingness to experiment, customer centricity and cooperation among
all disciplines. In this connection, we have launched a number of programs and initiatives in recent
years to honor the achievements of our scientists and provide them with suitable platforms and projects
for scientific discourse and cross-subgroup cooperation in scientific matters, as well as to give employees throughout all organizational units the opportunity to help jointly generate ideas or solve problems.

Globally reliable protection of intellectual property rights is essential for an innovation company like
Bayer. The Bayer Group endeavors to obtain patent protection for its products and technologies in the
major markets. The degree of protection a patent provides varies from one country to another and depends on the type and scope of the patent claim and the options available for enforcing our rights. At
the end of 2015, we owned approximately 66,700 valid patent applications and patents worldwide relating to some 7,200 protected inventions.
online annex: 3-4-3
Patent terms vary according to the laws of the country granting the patent. In view of the high investment required for product research and development, the European Union member states, the
United States, Japan and some other countries extend patent terms or issue supplementary protection certificates to compensate for the shortening of the effective patent protection period due to
regulatory approval processes for new drugs. We endeavor to obtain such extensions wherever possible.
The term of a patent is normally 20 years. Since it takes an average of 12 years to develop a new
medicine, for example, only eight years of patent protection generally remain following the product‚Äôs
approval. In most cases it would be impossible to cover the substantial costs incurred in the research
and development of innovative medicines or of new indications or dosage forms for existing drugs
without patent protection. We are therefore committed to protecting both the international patent
system and our own intellectual property worldwide. Further details are given in the political positions posted on our website.

We also operate our own science and innovation centers. We coordinate primarily our research partnerships in Asia through our science hubs in Beijing, China; Singapore; and Osaka, Japan. In Berlin, Germany, and San Francisco, California, United States, we operate the ‚ÄúCoLaborator‚Ñ¢,‚Äù an incubator model
for young life science companies. The objective of the global CoLaborator‚Ñ¢ concept is to offer these
companies suitable laboratory and office infrastructure in the direct vicinity of Bayer‚Äôs own research
facilities. In the area of crowdsourcing, we are very successfully continuing our ‚ÄúGrants4Targets‚Ñ¢‚Äù
program. We supplemented ‚ÄúGrants4Leads‚Ñ¢,‚Äù which concentrates on small molecules, with ‚ÄúPartnerYourAntibodies‚Ñ¢,‚Äù a program that focuses on the evaluation of biological actives. Furthermore, the
‚ÄúGrants4Apps‚Ñ¢ Accelerator Program‚Äù offers mentoring to start-up companies that can offer innovative
solutions relevant to health care and therapy. In the area of venture capital, we are active with the
‚ÄúHigh-Tech Gr√ºnderfonds‚Äù and Versant Ventures.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials account for a major portion of the development process for medicines. They are an essential tool for determining the efficacy and compatibility of new developmental products before they can
be used to treat diseases. The benefits and potential risks of new medicines must always be scientifically proven and well documented. All studies at Bayer satisfy strict international guidelines and quality
standards, as well as the respective applicable national laws and standards.
online annex: 3-4.1-1
Bayer publishes information about clinical trials in line with the respective applicable national laws
and according to the principles of the European (efpia) and North American (PhRMA) pharmaceutical associations, these principles being defined in a joint position paper.
HealthCare publishes information on its own clinical trials both in the publicly accessible register
www.ClinicalTrials.gov and in its own ‚ÄúTrial Finder‚Äù database. In the case of approved products,
summarized results of Phase ii, iii and iv clinical trials are accessible online through the ‚ÄúTrial
Finder.‚Äù Upon request, scientists can receive access to anonymized data at the patient level via the
portal www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com.
Further information on our globally uniform standards, the monitoring of studies and the role of the
ethics committees can be found on the internet.
Activities in 2015
In line with our targets for 2015 we transferred 12 new molecular entities from our research pipeline
into preclinical development in the reporting year. We define a new molecular entity (nme) as a new
chemical or biological substance that has not been in development to date. In preclinical trials these
substances are examined further in various models with respect to their suitability for clinical trials and
linked ‚Äúfirst-in-man‚Äù studies. In 2015, we conducted clinical trials with several drug candidates from our
research and development pipeline. We strengthened products that were already on the market through
life cycle management activities to improve their application and / or expand their spectrum of indications.

In 2015, we achieved further progress in various therapeutic areas:
Cardiology
Xarelto‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: rivaroxaban) has been approved for more indications in the area of venous
and arterial thromboembolism than any of the other non-vitamin-K-dependent oral anticoagulants.
Xarelto‚Ñ¢ is approved in more than 130 countries worldwide across all indications, its approval status
varying from country to country. Xarelto‚Ñ¢ is marketed in the United States by Janssen Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.
In May 2015, Xarelto‚Ñ¢ was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (cfda) for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment
of deep vein thrombosis (dvt). The approval also includes the use of Xarelto‚Ñ¢ to reduce the risk of
recurrent dvt and pulmonary embolism following acute dvt. In September 2015, Xarelto‚Ñ¢ was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (mhlw) for the treatment and secondary
prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis.
In addition to the already approved indications, the use of rivaroxaban is also being investigated in
other cardiovascular diseases such as prevention of major adverse cardiac events, embolic stroke of
undetermined source or peripheral artery disease.
Rivaroxaban was invented by Bayer and is being jointly developed with Janssen Research & Development, llc, United States, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.
Adempas‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: riociguat) is the first member of a new class of vasodilation agents
known as soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators. Administered in tablet form, riociguat is currently being investigated as an innovative, specific approach for the treatment of various forms of pulmonary hypertension.
Adempas‚Ñ¢ is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of particular forms of chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (cteph) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). In Japan,
Bayer was granted marketing authorization for cteph in 2014 and for pah in February 2015.
The trial program for riociguat also includes studies outside of the pulmonary hypertension indication.
For example, riociguat is also in Phase ii testing for the treatment of patients with diffuse systemic
sclerosis.
Another representative of the sGC modulator class is vericiguat, currently in Phase IIb clinical testing to
treat chronic heart failure.
The development and commercialization of sGC modulators is part of our strategic collaboration with
Merck & Co., Inc., United States.
The active ingredient finerenone (bay 94-8862) is a novel oral nonsteroidal mineralcorticoid receptor
antagonist (mra) that is currently in Phase iii clinical development. In September 2015, two Phase iii
trials were initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with diabetic kidney
disease. Another Phase iii trial is being prepared in the indication chronic heart failure.
The development candidate molidustat is being investigated for the treatment of patients with anemia
accompanied by chronic kidney disease and / or end-stage kidney failure.

In March 2015, we expanded our partnership with the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (mit) and Harvard University, United States, to include collaboration on cardiovascular
genomics and drug discovery.
In April 2015, furthermore, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., United States, pertaining to ionis-FXIRx (bay 2306001), an antisense drug in clinical development
for the prevention of thrombosis. Under the agreement, Bayer will further develop and commercialize
bay 2306001 in areas of high medical need. Antisense drugs bind to the mRNA molecules in the cell in
a targeted way and inhibit the production of proteins that may become significant in the course of a
disease. The novel mechanism of inhibiting Factor xi synthesis may offer an additional treatment option
for patients for whom none is currently available.
Oncology
Stivarga‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: regorafenib) is an oral multikinase inhibitor. It inhibits various signal
pathways that are responsible for tumor growth. Stivarga‚Ñ¢ is approved in the United States, Europe,
Japan and other countries for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist).
In March 2015, we suspended enrollment in a Phase iii trial with regorafenib due to insufficient patient
recruitment at that time. The trial is investigating regorafenib as an adjuvant treatment option for patients with colorectal cancer following resection of liver metastases with curative intent. The results of a
further Phase iii trial with regorafenib as a second-line treatment for liver cancer are expected in 2016.
Stivarga‚Ñ¢ was developed by Bayer. In 2011, Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of
Amgen Inc., United States, agreed that Onyx would receive royalties on global sales of Stivarga‚Ñ¢ in the
area of cancer treatment.
Xofigo‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: radium-223 dichloride) is approved in the e.u. and the United States for the
treatment of adult patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) with symptomatic bone metastases but no known visceral metastases. In April 2015, we submitted an application to the Japanese
health authority mhlw for marketing authorization for radium-223 dichloride for the treatment of prostate carcinoma with bone metastases. The active ingredient is being investigated in additional trials in
prostate cancer and in Phase ii trials involving breast cancer patients.
The active ingredient copanlisib is a novel, intravenous phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitor. In
2015, we expanded our global clinical development program. A new Phase ii and two Phase iii trials are
designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of copanlisib in patients with recurring indolent nonHodgkin lymphoma (nhl) and diffuse large b-cell lymphomas (dlbcl), an aggressive subtype of nhl.
Another active ingredient, bay-1841788 (odm-201), is being jointly developed with Orion Corporation,
Espoo, Finland. This novel oral androgen receptor inhibitor is in Phase iii clinical development for the
treatment of patients with prostate cancer.
In July 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sprint Bioscience ab, Sweden,
for the research, development and commercialization of oncological drug candidates. Under the agreement, we will receive the license for a research program currently undergoing preclinical development
that is geared toward the inhibition of tumor cell metabolism.

Ophthalmology
Eylea‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: aflibercept) is our joint development project with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States. Aflibercept blocks the natural growth factor vegf (vascular endothelial growth
factor), thus preventing the abnormal formation of new blood vessels that tend to leak fluid. The medication is administered directly into the eye. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States, holds exclusive rights to the product in the United States, while in other countries it is marketed by Bayer.
Eylea‚Ñ¢ is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (amd), visual impairment
due to macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (crvo) and diabetic macular edema
(dme). In Japan, Eylea‚Ñ¢ is additionally approved for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).
In February 2015, the European Commission extended marketing authorization for Eylea‚Ñ¢ to include
the treatment of patients with visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein
occlusion (brvo). Eylea‚Ñ¢ therefore can be used in Europe by all patients with visual impairment due to
macular edema resulting from retinal vein occlusion (rvo). In June 2015, the product was approved in
this indication in Japan. In October 2015, Eylea‚Ñ¢ was approved by the European Commission for the
treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).
A Phase IIa clinical study with regorafenib eye drops did not show the desired results and the project is
therefore being discontinued. The study investigated the use of regorafenib for the treatment of wet
age-related macular degeneration (amd).
In June 2015, we entered into a strategic research alliance with Johns Hopkins University, United States,
concerning the discovery and development of innovative drugs for the treatment of serious back-of-theeye diseases that affect many people worldwide. The five-year collaboration will aim to develop new
ophthalmic therapies for various retinal diseases.
Hematology
In June 2015, we submitted an application to the Japanese mhlw for marketing authorization for the
recombinant Factor viii compound bay 81-8973 for the treatment of hemophilia A. The approval process has been under way in the United States and Europe since the end of 2014. In December 2015,
the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (chmp) recommended approval. bay
81-8973 is a further development of recombinant Factor viii (rFVIII) which has demonstrated clinical
evidence of efficacy when used for prophylaxis twice or three times per week, with standard dosages.
Damoctocog alfa pegol (bay 94-9027) is a long-acting recombinant Factor viii that is currently in Phase
iii clinical development.
Gynecology
Vilaprisan (sPRM) is a novel oral progesterone receptor modulator that is currently being investigated in
Phase ii trials for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. In June 2015, an additional Phase
ii trial began that is investigating the efficacy of vilaprisan compared with its major competitor product.
In November 2015, we filed for marketing authorization for the new intrauterine system (ius) lcs-16 in
the European Union and the United States. This low-dose, levonorgestrel-releasing product enables
contraception for a period of up to five years.

In Consumer Care, research and development activities focus on the development of nonprescription
(over-the-counter = otc) medications as well as skin and foot care products, sunscreens, dietary supplements and other self-medication products. Placing the consumer at the center of everything we do,
our development strategies are geared toward expanding and improving our brand portfolio. We want
to achieve this through new product developments, forms, formulations, claims, pack designs and other
innovations. We introduced a number of new product line extensions to various markets in 2015. They
included new delivery forms and uses and innovations for existing brands such as Aspirin‚Ñ¢, Elevit‚Ñ¢,
Berocca‚Ñ¢, Canesten‚Ñ¢, Bepanthen‚Ñ¢ / Bepanthol‚Ñ¢ and Coppertone‚Ñ¢. We also actively pursue the reclassification of current prescription medicines as otc products.
The goal of our research and development activities in Medical Care is steadily to improve our contrast
agents and our contrast injection systems in order to build on our leadership position in the field of
radiology.
In March 2015, we received approval in Japan for Gadovist‚Ñ¢ (active ingredient: gadobutrol) injection for
use with resonance imaging (mri). Gadovist‚Ñ¢ is the first high concentration / high relaxivity gadoliniumbased contrast agent to be made available in Japan. In July 2015, Gadovist‚Ñ¢ was approved by the European Commission for use in children under two years of age. This label extension applies to all indications that have already been approved.
In August 2015, the MRXperion injection system was approved by the fda for the injection of contrast
agents. Our system optimizes injection workflow, provides enhanced point-of-care capabilities and can

While research is carried out centrally at a small number of sites, our development and plant breeding
activities take place both at these sites and at numerous field testing stations across the globe. This
ensures that future active ingredients and crop varieties can be tested according to specific regional and
local requirements. The research centers of the Seeds unit focus on improving seed and targeted seed
traits through seed technology and breeding.
In November 2015, CropScience opened three new institutes within the research and innovation center
at Paul√≠nia, Brazil: the company‚Äôs first applications technology center outside of Germany, a resistance
monitoring laboratory and a center for agriculture in tropical regions.
CROP PROTECTION / SEEDS
Research fields
In Crop Protection / Seeds our scientists working across the fields of improved seed traits, seed technology, seed breeding, agricultural chemistry and biologics closely collaborate as part of our integrated
research approach. This optimally bundles the technical expertise acquired in chemical and biological
research and field development, aligning it with our long-term research objectives and business strategies for the various crops.

75

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
4. Research, Development, Innovation

In the Crop Protection unit, we pursue the goal of identifying and developing innovative, safe products
for use as insecticides, fungicides, herbicides or seed treatments in sustainable agriculture. In the fields
of chemistry, biology and biochemistry, modern technologies such as high-throughput screening and
bioinformatics play an important role in identifying new chemical lead structures. In addition, we are
broadening the range of uses for our active ingredients by developing new mixtures or innovative formulations to enable their application in additional crops or in different regions and make them easier to
handle. Successful collaborations with external partners complement our own activities.
Research in our Seeds unit is devoted to optimizing plant traits. We are developing new varieties in our
existing core crops ‚Äì cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice and vegetables. We have now expanded our
research activities to include two further core crops ‚Äì wheat and soybeans. Our work focuses on improving the agronomic traits of these crops. Our researchers are working to increase the quality and yield
potential of crop plants ‚Äì for example by improving the profile of rapeseed oil or enhancing the properties of cotton fibers. We are also targeting the development of plants that have high tolerance to external stress factors such as drought, and can more efficiently utilize water. Further areas of focus include
developing new herbicide tolerance technologies based on alternative modes of action, and improving
insect resistance and disease tolerance. To do this we employ modern breeding techniques ranging
from marker-assisted breeding to plant biotechnology methods.
Technological advances offer farmers faster and more accurate methods of monitoring their plants.
Such digital solutions can help them to better understand processes in their fields and enable them to
make quicker and simpler decisions and calculate the risks more effectively. We would like to support
this development in the future by giving farmers specific agronomic recommendations. Therefore, in
addition to our conventional research projects, we are developing digital products in which we augment
field analyses and statistical models with additional data that we can adapt or individualize for a certain
field in order to help our customers to make decisions.
New products and registrations
In 2015, CropScience once again attained a series of important new registrations. In January 2015, for
example, we received regulatory approval from the u.s. Environmental Protection Agency (epa) for the
new insecticide Sivanto‚Ñ¢, which controls sucking pests on fruits and vegetables as well as most broadacre crops. Based on the active ingredient flupyradifurone, Sivanto‚Ñ¢ is a novel systemic insecticide.
CropScience received marketing authorization for this product in Mexico and South Korea in the spring
of 2015, and flupyradifurone was approved by the European Commission in November 2015. We anticipate attaining the first national registrations for Sivanto prime‚Ñ¢ in European countries in 2016; its market launch is planned for 2017.
The product Council‚Ñ¢ was already granted regulatory approval in South Korea in 2014 and it has been
available there since the 2015 planting season. The new rice herbicide will considerably improve weed
control, as it features a favorable environmental profile and outstanding compatibility ‚Äì characteristics
that make Council‚Ñ¢ an environmentally friendly and future-oriented product in the Asian rice market.
In August 2015, CropScience received marketing authorization from the European Commission for
terpenoid blend qrd 460, the active ingredient in the product Requiem‚Ñ¢. This biological insecticide
serves to control sucking pests. Its market launch in Europe is scheduled for 2017.
In September 2015, CropScience opened a new building for its European Wheat Breeding Center in
Gatersleben, Germany. Our wheat activities focus primarily on the development of hybrid seed that
promises considerably improved yield stability compared with conventional seed and is scheduled for
launch after 2020. CropScience announced in September 2014 that it will invest a total of ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in
the research and development of wheat seed and crop protection between 2010 and 2020. Here CropScience combines the discovery and development of plant traits, molecular breeding and the latest it
applications in order to optimize the genetic potential of wheat seed in terms of increased yields. In
2015, we took the first step in this direction by launching our first conventional wheat seed in Ukraine.

With many crops, such as vegetables, major success can be achieved using conventional plant breeding
methods. As vegetables are intended especially to be marketed and eaten fresh, merchants and consumers have particularly strict requirements regarding their appearance, nutrient content, taste and
shelf life. We are launching a succession of new vegetable seed varieties that satisfy these requirements.
Acquisitions and cooperation
In February 2015, representatives of Bayer CropScience and globalg.a.p. signed an agreement to further intensify their collaboration. The partners aim to implement sustainable cultivation methods and
help fruit and vegetable growers worldwide to meet globalg.a.p. certification standards.
Around the world, weed resistances to herbicides jeopardize agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
CropScience has significantly expanded its herbicides research capacities in order to be able to more
rapidly offer new solutions to global agricultural problems: in June 2015, CropScience and the Grains
Research & Development Corporation (grdc) entered into a five-year innovation partnership centered
partly on the accelerated discovery and development of new active ingredients to manage major and
resistant weed species. The grdc will finance the expansion of existing capacities at the global herbicides research center of CropScience in Frankfurt to include some 40 additional scientists and technicians.
In June 2015, CropScience announced the acquisition of SeedWorks India Pvt. Ltd., headquartered in
Hyderabad, India. The company is specialized in the breeding, production and marketing of hybrid
seeds of tomato, hot pepper, okra and gourds. Existing and forthcoming varieties will be marketed
under CropScience‚Äôs Nunhems‚Ñ¢ brand.
In September 2015, CropScience and the Round Table on Responsible Soy (rtrs) announced that they
would jointly assist soybean producers in the certification of their crops according to rtrs standards.
rtrs certification guarantees that soybeans ‚Äì whether used as a raw material or in processed products ‚Äì
originate from environmentally friendly, socially compatible and economically viable production. This
collaboration will initially be focused on Brazil.
Special mention should be made of our food chain partnerships, in which CropScience supports all the
players in the food chain ‚Äì from farmers and food processors to importers, exporters, wholesalers and
retailers. CropScience has participated worldwide in food chain partnership projects for 10 years, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Some 7,400 Bayer experts advise farmers on sustainable
cultivation methods ‚Äì from seed selection and the controlled, eco-friendly use of crop protection products to the transparent monitoring of production and assistance in attaining certifications.
online annex: 3-4.2-1
Our cooperation with partner organizations in these joint projects is now an internationally successful business model for all participants in the food chain. Smallholder farmers in developing countries
and Emerging Markets draw particular benefit from the improved production and marketing structures. Since 2014, we have significantly expanded our partnership with Unilever. This includes a
food chain partnership project in Kenya focused on rapeseed whose integrated solution comprises
crop protection, seed and support in certification attainment and agronomic training measures. The
goal of the project is to stabilize or even increase harvest yields and quality, and thus farmers‚Äô incomes.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
Research fields
Environmental Science offers consumers and professional users chemically and biologically based pest
and weed control solutions by tailoring substances from our Crop Protection unit or external partners
for use in the garden, on golf courses, on road- or railways or in forestry.
Activities in 2015
Environmental Science expanded its product range for professional users in the Middle East by introducing various innovative formulations of our insecticide Maxforce‚Ñ¢. The new biological product
Dedevap Green‚Ñ¢ is available in Germany for use in granaries. Environmental Science also cooperates
with companies in Brazil and Argentina to promote sustainable forestry ‚Äì through the use of products
such as our herbicide Esplanade Forest‚Ñ¢, which enables reduced application of herbicides thanks to its
long-lasting effect. We are continuously expanding our range of fungicides. Examples here include the
launch of Dedicate‚Ñ¢ in Europe, Chipco Signature Xtra‚Ñ¢ in the United States and the biological nematicide Nortica‚Ñ¢.
For consumers we continued to work in 2015 on the development of innovative and user-friendly packaging and the expansion of our range of biological solutions. We rounded out our range of pest
and weed control products with the launch of the new fungicides Consento‚Ñ¢ and Emerald‚Ñ¢ in central
Europe and Italy, the snail control product Dismo‚Ñ¢ in France and Austria and new formulations of
Decis Garten‚Ñ¢ in Italy and the Benelux countries.
For more than 50 years, Bayer has played an active role in the fight against malaria, which remains one
of the most dangerous tropical diseases to this day. Environmental Science is a leading supplier of indoor spray insecticides that control malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, protecting some 50 million people
a year from the disease. In 2015, Environmental Science received support from the World Health Organization of the United Nations (who) for the use of the Fludora‚Ñ¢ brand to combat malaria within the
context of integrated pest management. Environmental Science is also currently developing a new outdoor spray, K-Othrine Polyzone‚Ñ¢, to combat dengue fever in Southeast Asia. This product is targeted for
launch in 2017.

4.3 Covestro
Covestro operates major Innovation Centers in Leverkusen, Germany; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United
States; and Shanghai, China. With its strong global presence, the company endeavors to account particularly for regional market trends and customer needs.
Essential in this context is also cooperation with external scientific institutions, start-up companies and
academic spin-offs. These collaborations are mainly based in Germany, the United States, China or
Japan. Our partners in Germany include rwth Aachen University, while in China Covestro maintains a
close alliance with Tongji University, and in the United States Covestro supports research activities at a
number of renowned universities.
Research and development is a core element of Covestro‚Äôs corporate strategy so that the company can
maintain and build on its own competitive position. The company continuously works to evolve and
improve its products and manufacturing, processing and business procedures. It is ensured through
targeted management that ongoing projects and the project pipeline satisfy the current and future
needs of customer industries and ultimately the consumer markets.

The thematic focus is on high-end applications, the enhancement of functionalities, design flexibility,
cost-reducing production processes and sustainability, whereby the company also endeavors to find
alternatives to petrochemical raw materials.
The Polyurethanes (pur) Business Unit focuses among other things on driving forward new technologies such as microcellular foams that enable the development of even more efficient insulation of buildings and refrigeration chains. It also works to increase the flame-retardant properties of its materials.
Another current theme is lightweight composite materials, including applications in the automotive
industry that lead to weight savings and at the same time higher productivity and improved comfort.
In the area of process development, the business unit is progressing with the use of carbon dioxide as a
new source of carbon in order to reduce dependence on petrochemical raw materials. The pur Business
Unit‚Äôs first priority in 2016 is to launch an innovative co2-based form of the polyurethane component
polyol.
Activities in the Polycarbonates (pcs) Business Unit are mainly geared to the development of products
for the automotive and electrical / electronics industries. The focus here is on reducing weight, improving energy efficiency and safety, and enabling greater design freedom.
Light-emitting diodes contribute to sustainability in vehicles and in other applications, as they require
less energy and last longer than traditional light sources. pcs has developed special materials for channeling, scattering and reflecting led light and for discharging the generated heat. In addition, the business unit is channeling its focus on fiber-reinforced composites based on polycarbonates. These can
improve performance in high-grade it products and automotive components in particular.
The Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (cas) Business Unit is actively involved in the development
primarily of polyurethane-based raw materials for high-performance coatings, colorants, adhesives,
sealants and specialty products. One of the goals here is to open up new application possibilities and
markets for the core products. cas is also driving forward technologies such as processes that make use
of sustainable raw materials, focusing consistently on the needs of the market here as well.
In April 2015, for example, the business unit presented an innovative curing agent for polyurethane
coatings and adhesives for which 70% of the raw materials are derived from biomass that does not
compete with food production. cas has also developed a thermolatent curing agent for automotive coatings that can be applied at significantly lower temperatures than standard products. This in turn lowers
energy consumption and shortens production times. For textiles and artificial leather, furthermore, cas
offers a new generation of polyurethane dispersions that also conserve natural resources and do not
require the use of any organic solvents.

5. Sustainability Management and Governance
To us, sustainability basically means future viability and, as part of corporate strategy, is integrated into
everyday procedures.
We underline our mission as a sustainably operating company through our commitment to the u.n.
Global Compact with its internationally recognized 10 principles and to the Responsible Care‚Ñ¢ initiative, and through our active global involvement in leading (industry) forums such as the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (wbcsd).
Bayer also expressly backs the comprehensive approach of the new Sustainable Development Goals
(sdgs) agreed by the u.n. in September 2015 for the period to 2030. In our core business we support in
particular the goals that focus on combating hunger and ensuring good health care provision across the
globe. The other sdgs are also in line with our internal requirements relating to responsible business
practices.

materiality

The Sustainability Council sets targets, draws up initiatives, management systems and Group regulations, and is responsible for their implementation. In order to operationalize the Group strategy and
make it measurable, we have set ambitious nonfinancial targets and indicators all along the value chain.
Internal Group regulations ensure our sustainability principles are implemented in business operations,
where they are realized through corresponding management systems, regulations and processes.
We regularly check that our areas of activity are up to date and relevant. To do so, we analyze and evaluate what the major stakeholders expect and require and match this against our own assessment.
Thanks to this approach, we are quick to identify sustainability-related opportunities and risks and can
incorporate these into our strategy. In 2014, we used a multi-stage process to identify issues of relevance to us and prioritized these in respect of sales, costs, risk and reputation. We summarized the 24
areas of activity that are relevant to Bayer in a materiality matrix.
In 2015, we once again discussed the results of the materiality analysis at internal workshops and
reconciled these with current developments and the Group targets. We also analyzed the results‚Äô relevance for the Bayer value chain (see graphic) and reporting in line with the new gri g4 guidelines.
During this process, the original 24 areas of activity were condensed into 11, presented to the Board of
Management and approved by it. The graphic below shows the assignment of our areas of activity to
the stages of the value chain.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE AT BAYER
We consider the maintenance of constant contact and continuous dialogue with our stakeholders at a
global and local level to be very important. Bayer is a part of society and of public life. Society‚Äôs acceptance and appreciation of our corporate activities are therefore essential to Bayer‚Äôs reputation and
business success. Involving the different interest groups is a vital element of the company‚Äôs activities
with the goal of creating better mutual understanding and trust in respect of our work and products.
online annex: 3-5-1
We believe that systematic dialogue with the stakeholders relevant to us offers a vital key to
understanding their viewpoints and expectations and being able to incorporate them into our
business decision-making processes as far as possible. This procedure helps us to identify social and
market trends and developments early, avoid risks, assess our contribution and thereby set focus
areas for our corporate activities.
We systematically involve our stakeholders in various ways, including the Stakeholder Engagement
Process. This describes how, throughout the Group, stakeholder groups for a project can be identified, their expectations charted and dialogue with them steered. The engagement process requires
regular review and needs to be reflected against social trends.

To ensure the long-term acceptance and appreciation of our business, we seek to link the interests of
our stakeholders even more closely to our corporate strategy. It is important to approach key social
and political players right from the start of a new project and, early on, to canvass their support,
identify risks and opportunities and seek open dialogue. The Group has developed a guide to
engaging stakeholders in strategic decision-making processes such as investment projects and the
launch of new products. The Virtual Resource Center platform that emerged from this provides
online tools and a tutorial to help identify social and political trends at an early stage so that they can
be successfully incorporated into project planning. The concept is currently being applied to various
projects at Bayer, and the practical experience gathered is being channeled back into further
refinements. In addition, senior managers are systematically undergoing specific training to improve
interaction with critical stakeholders.

Our liaison offices in Berlin, Brussels, Washington, Moscow, Brasilia and Beijing are key points of
contact between the Group and the political arena. Bayer actively participates in existing transparency initiatives. It publishes details of costs, employee numbers and any of the other statistics required
in each country, e.g. in the transparency registers of the European institutions and the u.s. Congress.
Bayer goes way beyond the statutory requirements in doing so. For instance, the Group also publishes data for countries, e.g. in Germany, where there is no legal requirement to publish such information. In 2015, the costs incurred at the liaison offices for human resources, material and projects
totaled approximately: ‚Ç¨1.2 million in Berlin, Germany; ‚Ç¨2 million in Brussels, Belgium; ‚Ç¨6.9 million
in Washington, United States; ‚Ç¨0.14 million in Moscow, Russia; ‚Ç¨1.1 million in Brasilia, Brazil; and

and international level in order to play an active role in the common task of shaping sustainable development. Alongside exchange and cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (ngos) and supranational organizations, this primarily involves dialogue with the public.
Among other involvement, Bayer is actively engaged in the u.n. Global Compact and its initiatives,
the ceo Water Mandate and Caring for Climate, as well as the Global Compact lead network and
local Global Compact networks. We have also acted as an organizational stakeholder in the Global
Reporting Initiative since 2004.

HealthCare is an active participant in the social dialogue addressing sustainability issues and creates
forums to encourage exchange and develop viable problem-solving approaches together with partners. The subgroup supports the International Dialogue on Population and Sustainable Development
conference in close collaboration with various governmental and nongovernmental organizations.
The concept of this political dialogue involves finding solutions for internationally relevant issues in
reproductive health and sharing experiences of implementing the Millennium Development Goals.
Together with the dsw (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung ‚Äì the German foundation for world
population), HealthCare organizes a series of parliamentary evenings where experts in development
cooperation and representatives from the political sphere, foreign agencies, medical research, international ngos and think tanks discuss issues related to development policy and population growth.

CropScience wants to strengthen and expand societal dialogue about the need for and benefits of
science and innovation in agriculture and inform the public of the potential and challenges in today‚Äôs
agriculture. The Agricultural Education program is primarily aimed at encouraging young people to
take a greater interest in agriculture and food production. The program includes practical exercises
in student laboratories, agricultural science scholarships and sharing ideas about the future of agriculture at international youth conferences such as the Youth Ag-Summit.

GRI
G4-26, G4-27

In 2015, the second Youth Ag-Summit was held in Canberra, Australia, in partnership with the Australian agricultural youth organization ffn (Future Farmers Network). The focus was on nutrition for
the growing global population. At the end of the year, delegates from the Youth Ag-Summit presented a declaration by the young people on specific campaigns and recommendations for safeguarding
food supplies to the United Nations‚Äô Committee of World Food Security in Rome, Italy.
The neighborhoods near Bayer‚Äôs sites are a key subject in our stakeholder dialogue. The Group is
working at all sites on being recognized as a reliable partner and attractive employer that is aware of
its social responsibility. For example, the involvement of the local community plays a decisive role in
the success of any investment project.
CropScience regularly uses forums, print media and personal discussions with citizens‚Äô initiatives,
representatives of the church communities and the regional press to keep its neighbors continually
informed, for instance at the Dormagen, Frankfurt-Hoechst and Knapsack sites in Germany. Stakeholder dialogue is also taking place with the communities around sites in other countries, such as
Muskegon, United States, and Hangzhou, China.
Covestro engages in dialogue with neighbors, the public and non-governmental organizations (ngos)
on a case-by-case basis. The communities around the sites are proactively informed and involved
when it comes to investment projects. One example is the intensive voluntary information policy
adopted by Covestro and the German Chempark operator Currenta with respect to the relocation of a
section of the existing carbon monoxide pipeline under the Rhine between Dormagen and Leverkusen. The permit documentation for the culvert could be openly viewed by interested parties in both
cities affected and was additionally accessible on a specially dedicated website. For more detailed
up-to-date information go to www.dueker.chempark.de (in German only). Both the media and local
residents are kept informed about the planned carbon monoxide pipeline between the German sites
of Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen. The dialogue forum initiated by Covestro also plays an important role in the exchange of information with a critical public
In the United States, Covestro‚Äôs site dialogue takes place through local Community Advisory Panels
(caps). These, for example, organize regular meetings with local government or the community, in
order to provide information on current issues or news from the area of site safety. In Germany, dialogue with the community is conducted through the Chempark neighborhood offices run by Currenta
at the Lower Rhine sites.
Among other things, Covestro is a member of the u.n. Global Compact and is active in econsense. It
also maintains various partnerships with ngos as part of a commitment to wider society, for instance
with Habitat for Humanity, which seeks to build sustainable and affordable housing in India.

Our business success is based to a large extent on the knowledge, skills, commitment and satisfaction of
our employees. The aim of human resources work at Bayer is to create a working environment that
encourages personal development and where every employee can drive forward innovations and
achieve an excellent performance. Our corporate culture therefore builds on integrity, fosters strengths,
identifies potential and helps us in our common goal of attracting the most talented employees and
retaining them in the company in the long term.
Our human resources work starts with selecting and hiring new employees. We reward achievement
and encourage ongoing development. We constantly develop our organizational structures and adapt
them to the changing business environment. In addition, we have a wide range of initiatives and offerings to help managers lead their teams and enable employees to perform optimally.
The global strategy introduced by the Human Resources (hr) Committee helps us meet present and
future business requirements. The hr Committee sets binding policies and defines priorities for all
regions and organizational units. It is chaired by the member of the Board of Management responsible
for human resources.

See Chapter 1.4
for Group targets

To monitor the effectiveness of our human resources work, we conduct a Group-wide Employee Survey
every two years. This is supplemented by institutionalized feedback processes and analyses. The information we receive in this way is used to steadily improve our activities. One area of focus derived from
the results of the last Employee Survey was improving our innovation culture. Cultivating innovation has
therefore been integrated into the Bayer Competency Model as one of the key leadership competencies
and we have introduced new initiatives such as the ‚ÄúWeSolve‚Äù knowledge platform. Further information
on Bayer‚Äôs innovation culture can be found in Chapter 4 ‚ÄúResearch, Development, Innovation.‚Äù

IDENTIFYING TALENTS
Bayer actively encourages its employees to develop their individual abilities, talents and strengths.
Scientific innovations, changing customer requirements and a strong competitive environment are just
some of the reasons why we welcome open-minded employees. A professional approach to attracting
suitable talents is key to this. In 2015 we successfully continued the rollout of our uniform employer
branding ‚ÄúPassion to Innovate | Power to Change.‚Äù This message expresses what Bayer expects of its
employees and, at the same time, what it can offer them. The employer branding ‚ÄúPassion to Innovate |
Power to Change‚Äù was deployed worldwide for internal communication with employees in 2015 and
was also used to position Bayer as an employer in many key markets. In addition, in 2015 we took the
first steps toward further optimizing Group-wide recruitment of new employees. This was supported by

Vocational training plays an important role at Bayer in order to meet the need for skilled employees. We
provide sound training in more than 20 different occupations and offer more vocational training places
than required to meet our needs. In Germany alone, around 920 young people embarked on a vocational training course at Bayer in 2015. We also give young people an opportunity to gain an insight into
working for our company at any early age. Overall, Bayer provided around 2,900 demanding professional internships for students around the world in 2015.
PRESENT EMPLOYEE DATA
On December 31, 2015, Bayer had around 116,800 employees worldwide, a slight decrease compared

The voluntary fluctuation rate shows that we were again successful in retaining staff in the company
long-term. On the reporting date, our employees had worked for the company for an average of 11
years. The proportion of employee-driven terminations (voluntary fluctuation) was 5.0% in 2015, level

The data include all employer- and employee-driven terminations, retirements and deaths.
The comparatively high proportion of employees in the <30 age group is due to the inclusion of employees on temporary contracts
(working for 2‚Äì6 months of the year) and other short-term employees. It does not include apprentices.

At our significant locations of operation, which represent a selection of countries in which we generate
around 68% of our total sales, Bayer also uses temporary personnel from staffing agencies on a small
scale, based on stringent rules that are rooted in the life values.
online annex: 3-6-4
Temporary personnel from staffing agencies are primarily used where this is necessary as a result of
short-term personnel requirements, fluctuations in order levels, temporary projects or long-term illness. The proportion of temporary staff employed in Germany is around 2.9% of the total workforce,
and the average for the significant locations of operation is 7.5%.

6.1 Utilizing Potential to the Full:
Personnel Development at Bayer
We aim to develop our employees on the basis of their abilities. To ensure this, in 2015 we introduced
the Bayer Competency Model as a uniform, Group-wide standard. It comprises 16 clearly defined core
and leader competencies, which are derived from our business strategy and life values. They enable
both employees and managers to use a common language and enhance transparency of the skills and
behaviors we expect from both current and future employees.
This common understanding facilitates development opportunities for employees and at the same time
gives them guidance on their career path. The Bayer Competencies are now used as criteria for many
employee development tools, ranging from recruitment interviews through the Development Dialogue
to various Assessment Centers to identify future managers. In 2015, 28,000 nonmanagerial staff and
23,000 managerial staff around the world were trained to use the competencies in interviews and Development Dialogues.
The aim of the Development Dialogue is to draw up an individual development plan that fosters employees‚Äô strengths and addresses areas in which they would like to develop further. 30,000 Development
Dialogues were held in 2015. They are an opportunity for employees to discuss their personal strengths
and development needs, career expectations and professional aspirations with their supervisor. This tool
is to be rolled out Group-wide and given a firm place in our global leadership culture. In 2015, the Development Dialogue was extended to nonmanagerial employees in Germany.

Thanks to its wide-ranging business activities, Bayer is able to offer employees throughout the Group
good opportunities for development. Vacancies throughout the Bayer Group, from nonmanagerial right
up to senior management level, are advertised via a globally accessible platform. In 2015, we posted
around 13,000 vacancies in 61 countries on this platform.
Selective training is also part of our philosophy of personnel development. We actively encourage ‚Äúlifelong learning‚Äù by our employees as an integral element in the management of demographic change.
Our aim is to empower all employees to broaden their knowledge and skills and keep up with the latest

We have training programs for all employees throughout the company. An overview of the various programs, together with details of their aims and uptake can be found on the internet.
At the heart of our ongoing training concept is the Group-wide Bayer Academy, which bundles our
extensive range of continuing education offerings. Alongside systematic development of managerial
employees, it offers continuous professional training through various functional academies. Managers
from different management levels have taken a total of 31,966 training courses through the programs
offered by the Bayer Academy for managers since 2013, including 11,623 in 2015. In 2015, the Bayer
Academy was honored with the renowned Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award in bronze for its training offerings to enhance the performance and feedback culture. A total of 302,205 training sessions in
Skill & Competency were taken by managers across all managerial levels.
Every employee at our significant locations of operation received an average of 20.0 hours of vocational
and ongoing training.

ACHIEVING EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE ‚Äì FOSTERING FLEXIBILITY
Above-average performance is only possible in an environment where fairness and respect are key
elements of the corporate culture. That includes observing Bayer-wide standards of conduct and protecting employees from discrimination, harassment and retaliation. These standards are set forth in the
corporate policy on Fairness and Respect at Work.
Specific and differentiated feedback forms the basis for positive personal development. Bayer encourages a culture of candid feedback to help employees achieve their individual goals. The global performance management system is part of this culture. Employees agree individual objectives with their
supervisor that are directly based on corporate goals. Alongside continuous feedback throughout the
year, attainment of the objectives is assessed by the supervisor at the end of the year and discussed
personally with each employee. The results are documented in the employee portal and made available
to each employee on an individual basis. In 2015, this system covered more than 88,000 employees, i.e.
about 75% of our total workforce. Of the participants, 42% were female and 58% male. The system is
mandatory for all managerial employees. This ensures that they receive feedback on how well they have
applied our corporate values in the fulfillment of their individual objectives. Applying the life values is
as important as meeting business targets and therefore affects the level of their variable compensation.

Bayer‚Äôs corporate culture is shaped by its employees. As a modern employer, Bayer endeavors to respond to employees‚Äô widely differing lifestyles. The company therefore offers employees in all countries
a wide range of options to help them balance employment with their personal and family lives. Today‚Äôs
employees and prospective employees attach great importance to flexible working arrangements and to
support in caring for children and close relatives. Bayer offers a variety of flexible working opportunities
throughout the world. In many countries, these go well beyond the statutory requirements. We significantly expanded our benefits and services in this area in 2015, for example in China.
In 2015, Bayer concluded a new General Works Agreement with the Works Council in Germany on a
binding and uniform framework for short-term mobile working. For the first time, this agreement is
applicable throughout the Group.
We regularly conduct extensive global surveys of family-friendly working arrangements. In 2015, these
showed further progress at our significant locations of operation. New and improved programs for
flexible working from home, flextime and caring for relatives have been introduced. In 2015, the Bayer
Group had some 10,200 part-time employees, in particular in Europe. This figure represents 8.5% of
the total headcount.

Bayer enables both men and women to take parental leave. Since national parental leave regulations
vary widely from country to country, we only compile data for our significant locations of operation.
Group-wide 1,315 women and 788 men took parental leave in 2015. By the end of the year, around
1,847 employees on parental leave had returned to work. 81% of women and 99% of men who took

The General Works Agreement on caring for close relatives helps Bayer employees in Germany to combine working with their role as carers.
online annex: 3-6.1-4
Under this agreement, employees can take up to 10 days‚Äô paid leave to provide emergency care for
family members. For longer periods, they are entitled to work part-time. During this time, their salary
can be topped up by drawing funds from their long-term account. Alternatively, employees who need
to care for close relatives full-time can take unpaid leave for up to six months (or up to one year in
exceptional cases). The new General Works Agreement on mobile working, which includes working
from home for short periods, also offers employees greater flexibility in dealing with personal emergencies.

EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION
We regard providing regular, up-to-date information for our employees and involving them through
active dialogue as an integral part of modern human resources and talent management based on competitive structures and processes. To ensure this, Bayer stepped up open and transparent communication with employees in 2015. The previously separate intranet sites providing hr information, company
news, country-specific information and background facts have been combined, offering extensive information on career paths, compensation, training and benefits.
Communication with employees also includes meeting national and international obligations to inform
staff promptly and extensively about upcoming changes in the Group.
In Germany we combine providing timely information to the employee representatives on the Economics Committee of the company concerned with coordinating and jointly deciding on the proposed communication measures.
We also actively involve our employees in dialogue through a range of offerings and specifically encourage open discussion. These include regular employee assemblies, information events for managers and
the European Forum, where employee representatives from all European sites engage in discussion with
the Board of Management. Particular attention is paid to explaining strategic issues, business performance, research, innovation and sustainability.

6.2 Diversity and Internationality
A diverse employee structure is vital for our company‚Äôs future competitiveness. Diversity improves our
understanding of changing markets and consumer groups, gives us access to a broader pool of talented
employees, and enables us to benefit from the enhanced innovative and problem-solving abilities that
are demonstrably associated with a high cultural diversity within the company.
A better gender and cultural balance at management level is especially important for our success as a
company. Our activities in this area are bundled in ‚ÄúLeading Across Cultures and Genders.‚Äù At the heart
of this program are special training sessions for managers. These provide an opportunity for them to
consider the economic benefits of greater diversity, cultural and gender-specific differences and positive
examples from within the Group in order to develop action plans for their own areas of responsibility.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which was set up in the summer of 2015. The members of this initiative are committed to working together to develop practically oriented strategies to drive diversity
and gender balance in their organizations.
Overall, the Bayer Group employs people from around 150 different nations. Of the members of our
Group Leadership Circle, in which 33 nationalities are currently represented, around 67% come from
the country in which they are employed. The Group Leadership Circle comprises managers who perform senior functions in the Group. At the end of 2013, 82% of senior managers in our five top contract
levels came from Western Europe, the United States and Canada and 18% came from other countries.
By the end of 2015, the proportion of employees in the latter group had increased by three percentage
points to 21%. We aim to increase this to 25% by 2020.

Group target 2015:
increase in the
proportion of senior
managers from outside
the E.U., the United
States or Canada to
25%

In 2010, Bayer set itself the voluntary target of raising the proportion of women at the five highest management levels throughout the Group to 30% by the end of 2015. In just five years, we have increased
the proportion of women in this management segment from 21% to around 28%. We aim to raise this
to 35% by 2020.

Group target 2015:
increase in the
proportion of women
in senior management

6.3 Employee Compensation and Variable Pay
Compensation at Bayer combines a basic salary reflecting performance and responsibility with elements
based on the company‚Äôs success, plus extensive additional benefits. In this way, we aim to offer our
employees working conditions that give them a high degree of security and reliability. Adjustments
based on continuous benchmarking are designed to ensure that our compensation is always internationally competitive. We also attach great importance to equal pay for men and women, providing fair
and competitive compensation worldwide and informing our employees transparently about the overall
structure of their compensation.
online annex: 3-6.3-1
At Bayer, individual salaries are based on each employee‚Äôs personal and professional abilities and the
level of responsibility assigned to them. At managerial level, this is based on uniform evaluation of all
positions throughout the Group using the internationally recognized Hay method. In areas of the
Group and jobs that fall within the scope of binding collective bargaining agreements, there are no
differences in pay based on gender either. This also applies for the compensation of trainees. In the
Emerging Markets and developing countries, too, compensation levels are aligned to local market
conditions. To provide a transparent overview of their compensation, including all additional benefits
provided by the company and employer pension and social insurance contributions, more than
30,000 employees in 12 countries up to now annually receive an extensive ‚ÄúTotal Reward Statement‚Äù
containing all relevant information. This will be rolled out successively to further countries in the
next few years.
Our compensation concept also includes variable one-time payments. More than ‚Ç¨1,100 million is earmarked for bonus awards to employees for 2015 under the Group-wide short-term incentive (sti) program. In many countries, employee stock programs enable our staff to purchase Bayer shares at a discount. This offers them a further opportunity to participate in the company and its business performance. We also offer senior managers throughout the Group ‚ÄúAspire,‚Äù a uniform long-term compensation program based on the development of the share price (see note [26.6] to the consolidated financial
statements). For members of the Group Leadership Circle, an appropriate personal investment in Bayer
stock is the prerequisite for participating in this program.
In the continuing operations, our personnel expenses amounted to ‚Ç¨11,203 million in 2015 (2014:
‚Ç¨9,693 million). The change was mainly due to currency effects, an increase in average employee numbers, and higher employee bonuses. Offering a stable income and financial security is a basic principle
of our global compensation strategy. This also applies to financial security in old age. More than 70% of
Bayer employees worldwide are included in a Bayer pension plan. Pension provision is available to most
employees for the period after their retirement. The way these benefits are provided varies according to
the legal, fiscal and economic conditions of each country, the benefits generally being based on employee compensation and years of service. Further details of pension provision and pension obligations
are given in note [29] to the consolidated financial statements.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Our social responsibility as a company and an employer is based on our corporate values and our unreserved commitment to supporting and fostering human rights in our sphere of influence. Bayer‚Äôs Human Rights Position is set out in a binding Group-wide policy. We are committed to respecting, fostering and reporting transparently on human rights both internally and within our sphere of influence. That
means, in particular, that we have policies, processes and monitoring systems to enforce human rights
in our business operations. Alongside working conditions in the Bayer Group, these outline our expectation that human rights will be respected at all stages in the supply chain, as detailed in our Supplier
Code of Conduct. In addition, our life values and Corporate Compliance Policy commit all employees
around the world to fair and lawful conduct toward staff, colleagues, business partners and customers.
We are a founding member of the un Global Compact and respect the United Nations‚Äô Declaration of
Human Rights and a range of globally recognized declarations applicable for multinational corporations.

See Chapter 7.1

online annex: 3-6.3-2
These include, in particular, the oecd Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ilo). We also observe the u.n. Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights, which were adopted in 2011. To implement these, in 2015, we played
an active part in the consultation process, which aims to support the German government in drafting
a national action plan.
To enhance our employees‚Äô awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day activities,
we trained around 52% of our workforce in the main aspects of our Human Rights Position at various
courses with a total duration of 201,000 hours in 2015. That included training for internal and external
security staff. The compliance organizations at Group and country levels monitor compliance with the
relevant corporate policies. If there are signs of violation, employees can contact their Compliance Officer at any time, anonymously if required. Alternatively, they can contact the Group-wide compliance
hotline, which is available worldwide to the general public as well as to employees. For further details
see Chapter 16.3 ‚ÄúCompliance.‚Äù
At Bayer, social responsibility includes ensuring safe working conditions and thus an environment
where our employees can work and undertake international business travel without fear. We support
our employees by providing training to prepare them for business trips, including training in the correct
conduct in emergencies.

See Chapter 16.3

Our social responsibility is also reflected in our approach to necessary changes and restructuring
measures. In Germany, which remains the company‚Äôs largest operational base with 36,700 employees,
business-related dismissals are excluded through the end of 2020 for a large proportion of employees
under an agreement with the employee representatives.
In 2015, the working conditions for around 53% of our employees worldwide were governed by collective or company agreements. The contractually agreed working hours of our employees do not exceed
48 hours a week in any country. At various country companies, the interests of the workforce are represented by elected employee representatives who have a right to be consulted on certain personnelrelated decisions.

Our understanding of our role as a socially responsible company includes a commitment to helping
disadvantaged people. We employ some 2,500 people with disabilities in 29 countries. That is around
2% of our total workforce. 35% are female and 65% male. Most employees with disabilities work for
our companies in Germany, where they made up 4.9% of the workforce in 2015.
An important part of our sustainable human resources policy is ensuring a high level of social protection
for our employees. For example, nearly all employees worldwide either have statutory health insurance
or can obtain health insurance through the company. In 2015, we once again expanded or improved the
quality of the health benefits provided for employees in many countries. 78% of employees have access
to a company pension plan.

Employees‚Äô health and vitality are important to Bayer. The company therefore specifically encourages
health awareness and healthy lifestyles. We have therefore introduced a wide range of workplace
health management programs at all levels, which are being expanded in response to employee surveys.
Further information can be found in Chapter 9.1 ‚ÄúOccupational Health and Safety.‚Äù

7. Procurement, Production, Logistics,
Distribution
We strive to offer our customers innovative products and high-quality solutions. This requires efficient
processes all along the value chain for our products ‚Äì in procurement, production, logistics and distribution. Economic factors play a role here, as do ecological and social criteria such as comprehensive
product stewardship, human rights and a clear commitment to safety and environmental protection.
At our production sites throughout the world, we continuously work to improve our cost structure, react
more rapidly to market fluctuations through increased flexibility and achieve our ambitious quality and
safety objectives. The quality requirements for our products and services vary due to divergent regulatory demands: the manufacture of pharmaceutical and medical devices in particular is subject to extraordinarily stringent requirements.
This chapter presents the (internal) value chain: how we procure, manufacture and transport our products, as well as how we market and distribute them.

7.1 Procurement and Supplier Management
Bayer‚Äôs procurement organization supplies our internal business partners around the world with goods
and services while operating in accordance with the ethical, ecological, social and economic principles
established in our procurement directive. This directive is binding for all employees. Our procurement
activities aim to ensure security of supply, provide a financial value contribution and meet quality and
sustainability requirements. Procurement makes a substantial value contribution to the Bayer Group by
centrally pooling know-how, leveraging network effects and economies of scale throughout the organization and facilitating access to innovation.
We exert significant influence on society and the environment in many regions as a result of our procurement activities, which in 2015 took place in 151 (2014: 147) countries and accounted for a procurement spend of some ‚Ç¨22.2 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨20.3 billion) from transactions with approximately
112,500 (2014: approximately 112,000) suppliers in all areas.
In 2015, our procurement spend in Germany, the United States and Japan accounted for nearly 67% of
our expenditures in oecd (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, which
in turn made up about 53% of the Bayer Group‚Äôs global procurement spend. Brazil, India and China
together accounted for about 68% of expenditures in the non-oecd countries or about 14% of the total
spend.

Where possible, Bayer buys locally. In 2015, this applied to 75% of our procurement spend at our
main business locations, and 71% of our total worldwide procurement spend. This enables us to align
our procurement activities to the requirements of our sites in the regions and to help strengthen local
economies.
Bayer minimizes procurement-specific risks for goods and services of strategic importance, such as
supply bottlenecks or major price fluctuations, through long-term contracts and active supplier management. In this way we ensure both the company‚Äôs global competitiveness and smooth production
processes.
Indirect goods that are not of relevance to production are procured by the respective major user within
the Bayer Group. The individual procurement organizations were coordinated during the reporting
period by the Group Procurement Committee, which reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. In
line with the company‚Äôs procurement strategy, direct and production-related procurement in the Bayer
Group is organized decentrally in the subgroups so that Bayer can act in accordance with differentiated market and production requirements. The composition of HealthCare‚Äôs supplier portfolio has
changed as a result of the acquisitions of the nonprescription medicines businesses of Merck & Co.,
Inc. and Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., as well as the divestiture of the Diabetes Care business.

Key basic raw materials are benzene and phenol, propylene oxide, toluene, acetone
and hexamethylenediamine.

The use of renewable raw materials currently plays only a subordinated role at Bayer. We use them
more intensively when it makes technical, economic and ecological sense to do so.
online annex: 3-7.1-3
A number of hormones are synthesized at HealthCare through certain sterols and phytosterols
that result as byproducts during the production of plant oils from soybeans, oilseed rape /
canola or sunflowers, as well as during wood processing. Palm oil or palm kernel oil is not
used here due to its low sterol content. We additionally purchase various steroids that are
manufactured from diosgenin or its intermediate stages. Today, this substance is usually obtained from yam grown in countries such as China. We also use raw materials such as water,
glucose, yeast, soybean starch, castor oil and corn steep water in our fermentation processes.
Extracts of plant leaves (Centella asiatica) are used in some Consumer Care products. This
plant is widely found in Asia and is not an endangered species. We also take great care with
the cultivation and harvesting of the raw materials for manufacturing plant-based pharmaceuticals for holistic treatments. They are collected and cultivated in line with the gacp (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) guidelines of the European Medicines Agency.
On the European market, CropScience offers a mild weed control product based on fatty acids
derived from palm oil. As the production of palm oil is often associated with social and ecological problems, Bayer takes part in the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil (rspo). This underscores our commitment to responsible materials procurement. In 2015, Bayer for the second time purchased GreenPalm certificates, which support the production of sustainable palm
oil.
Covestro is developing processes for the replacement of raw materials derived from crude oil.
In 2016, for example, the company is planning the commercial production and market launch
of pentamethylene diisocyanate (pdi), an isocyanate produced from a novel renewable raw material derived in turn from biomass.

Sustainability in supplier management
Bayer regards adherence to sustainability standards within its supply chain as both a crucial factor for
value creation and an important lever for minimizing risks. For this reason, not just economic standards,
but also ethical and environmental, social and governance (esg) standards apply for the selection of new
as well as established suppliers. These standards are defined in Bayer‚Äôs Supplier Code of Conduct,
which is based on the principles of the u.n. Global Compact and our Human Rights Position. It forms
the basis for our collaboration with suppliers and is available online in 14 languages. The Code of Conduct is integrated into electronic ordering systems and contracts throughout the Bayer Group. Since
2015, furthermore, relevant new and renewed supply contracts have contained special clauses that
request suppliers to observe the sustainability requirements defined in the Code of Conduct and authorize Bayer to monitor this.
Group targets: supplier
management
See also Chapter
1.4 for Group
targets

In order to consistently drive sustainability in supplier management, Bayer has set ambitious targets. By
2017, we plan to evaluate all strategically important suppliers i.e. those with a major influence on business in terms of, for example, procurement spend and long-term collaboration prospects (3-5 years)
according to sustainability-relevant criteria (target attainment as of 2015: 84%). By 2020, we also aim
to include in the evaluation all those suppliers with a significant procurement spend (> ‚Ç¨1 million p.a.)
that are regarded as potential high-risk suppliers (target attainment as of 2015: 73%). Risk definition is
based on a country- and material-based approach. Another objective is the development and establishment of a sustainability standard for our supply base by 2020. Here we are working with both the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (psci). The goals
include standardizing and sharing sustainability assessments and audits of suppliers in the same industry and describing clear expectations regarding sustainability so as to establish appropriate sustainability practices among our suppliers. The TfS initiative counts 16 and the psci 19 participating companies.
A key challenge for sustainable supplier management in the Bayer Group is to prevent child labor in the
seed supply chain of our CropScience subgroup.
Our Human Rights Position is unequivocal and includes a strict ban on child labor. We therefore also
obligate our suppliers along our supply chain strictly to refrain from employing children. For many
years, CropScience has taken systematic action to prevent child labor in the seed supply chain in India,
Bangladesh and the Philippines through its Child Care Program. Special teams from Bayer visit the
fields used, for example, in cotton, rice and vegetable seed production without prior notice throughout
the cultivation season in order to raise awareness of the issue and the Bayer requirements and to determine the age of the workers there. Thanks to this stringent monitoring system, which is supported by
local educational initiatives, there are now only very few incidences of child labor among our contractors, and we are closely tracking these cases. Further risk assessments were carried out in vegetable
and rice seed production for Bayer in Thailand, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. It is planned to introduce
the Child Care Program in these countries as well in 2016. We measure the success of our comprehensive program using the indicators ‚ÄúChild labor incidence per monitored km¬≤‚Äù and ‚ÄúChild labor incidence as a percentage of total monitorings of laborers.‚Äù
In the following diagram depicting the latter indicator, we demonstrate the continued elimination of
child labor in Indian cotton and vegetable seed production sites contracted by Bayer based on the results of field monitoring.

Suppliers who can verify that they strictly observe our ban on child labor receive a bonus from Bayer
along with training in raising agricultural efficiency. Graduated sanctions are applied for noncompliance. These range from written warnings to termination of the contract in the case of repeated noncompliance.
Bayer regards school attendance not only as essential for children‚Äôs development but also as an effective tool to drive the elimination of child labor. We therefore also visit the parents of children we
find working in the fields to convince them of the importance of school education. We promote this
with the ‚ÄúLearning for Life‚Äù initiative within our Child Care Program. This initiative aims to ensure
that children and young people get a proper education and covers everything from reintegrating
children into the regular school system to vocational training measures. Between 2005 and the end
of 2015, the ‚ÄúLearning for Life‚Äù educational programs benefited more than 6,100 children and young
people.
The Child Care Program Advisory Council, comprised of international experts and recognized professionals, supports Bayer in the protection of children‚Äôs rights and the obligation of seed production
without child labor. The annual meeting of the Advisory Council, which took place in India in May
2015, focused on the effectiveness of the Child Care Program and on a project concerning minimum
wages in the seed supply chain.
Evaluating the sustainability performance of our suppliers
Bayer verifies the observance of sustainability requirements by our suppliers through online assessments and on-site audits. Suppliers are selected for these evaluations based on a combination of country and material risks as well as strategic importance in accordance with our Group targets.
The online assessments are carried out on Bayer‚Äôs behalf by EcoVadis, an established provider of sustainability performance evaluations. They are comprised of a web-based, modular questionnaire completed by the supplier, coupled with accompanying verification documents and 360¬∞ screening. The
evaluation criteria comprise the areas environment, labor practices and human rights, fair business
practices and sustainable procurement.
Together with external, independent auditors, Bayer carries out on-site audits of its suppliers based on
the psci and TfS sustainability criteria. In addition, internal auditors evaluate suppliers with a focus on
health and safety, environmental protection and sustainability.
Through cooperation with the industry initiatives psci and TfS, we leverage synergies through the
exchange of comparable, high-quality supplier assessments and / or audits among members using the it
platforms of the respective initiatives.

total of 40 joint and / or shared audits were carried out in 2015 through psci, for example in Turkey,
Brazil and Uruguay.
Alongside consideration of our sustainability criteria in the selection of suppliers, CropScience and
HealthCare undertake separate evaluations of suppliers with regard to the contract manufacturing of
quality-relevant goods and services. These evaluations encompass the areas of health, safety and environmental protection among others and are performed prior to the start of operations. Since 2015,
furthermore, HealthCare has obligated newly selected suppliers with a prospective annual procurement spend in excess of ‚Ç¨1 million to undergo an EcoVadis sustainability assessment or an on-site
audit after being awarded business. The suppliers evaluated in 2015 in this context satisfied our sustainability requirements.
Moreover, Bayer monitors suppliers who process minerals such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold to
establish whether these originate in conflict regions. In this way we want to rule out that such materials
find their way into our products through supply chains. To tighten up our requirements, the issue of
conflict materials has also been included in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
online annex: 3-7.1-6
International regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States obligate companies to disclose the origin of certain raw materials to rule out that conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its neighboring countries find their way into products through supply chains.
Bayer has questioned about 100 suppliers who could potentially be impacted by this issue. Nearly
60% of them confirmed to us that they do not procure potential conflict minerals. The status of the
remaining suppliers is being clarified.
All online assessments and audits are comprehensively analyzed and documented so that ‚Äì in the event
of unsatisfactory results ‚Äì specific improvement measures can be defined together with the suppliers to
ensure the future observance of social, ethical and environmental standards. In 2015, 33 suppliers
(equivalent to 6% of those evaluated) posted a critical result. These suppliers were requested by Bayer
to rectify the identified weaknesses with the help of corrective instructions or action plans.
online annex: 3-7.1-7
The corrective action established together with the suppliers in 2015 mainly related to the areas of
occupational health, occupational safety, fair business practices and sustainable procurement. In
2015, we monitored the implementation of the stipulated improvements among 324 suppliers by
means of reassessments through the EcoVadis platform; approximately 73% improved their sustainability performance to a relevant degree. In 2015, Bayer was not prompted to end any supplier relationship due solely to sustainability performance or serious sustainability deficiencies.
Training measures and dialogue on the issue of sustainability
We support our hseq and procurement employees in the implementation of our sustainability requirements with targeted Group-wide training measures. In the reporting period, 162 of these employees
completed training courses dealing with the EcoVadis sustainability assessment process. CropScience
carried out additional training courses on the subject of sustainability audits. HealthCare organized
supplementary sustainability workshops for selected procurement employees. In addition, we also offer
our suppliers a wide range of training and dialogue opportunities in order to familiarize them with
Bayer‚Äôs sustainability requirements.
online annex: 3-7.1-8
In 2015, Bayer once again held Supplier Days, which are an important dialogue platform for our
subgroups. CropScience organized special training courses on quality, health and safety, and environmental protection for selected suppliers. The TfS initiative organized Supplier Days in China and
Brazil that dealt, for example, with environmental protection and occupational safety. In India, psci
held an education conference where suppliers were trained in occupational safety, environmental
protection, process and plant safety, and labor and business ethics. Both initiatives offer extensive
supplementary information material and online training courses on their websites.

7.2 Production
Bayer operates production facilities at more than 120 sites in 35 countries. We deploy our competencies
and experience at all our sites to continuously optimize production processes and technologies, as well
as infrastructure. That is because product quality and the efficiency of materials and energy are crucial
competitive factors.
The safe and responsible operation of our facilities and the comprehensive safety of our employees and
the people who live near our sites are of utmost importance to Bayer. Bayer also places great importance on protecting the environment and using natural resources responsibly. Accordingly, management systems have been established for the areas of health, safety, environmental protection and
quality (hseq) that apply throughout the Bayer Group. They are integrated into all business processes
and regularly audited and updated. All relevant hseq performance indicators from our production sites
are compiled in a Group-wide Bayer site information system (BaySIS). Extensive information on the
topics of safety, product stewardship, environmental protection and the corresponding management
systems can be found in chapters 8, 9 and 10.
HEALTHCARE
SITES
HealthCare operates production sites around the world at which active ingredients are manufactured
and at which formulation and packaging services are performed for the product portfolio of all
HealthCare divisions. The importance of the production sites within the network is regularly assessed,
giving consideration to site- and product-specific criteria. Product supply strategies and site strategies
are further developed and / or adjusted on this basis. The most important production and formulation

QUALITY MANAGEMENT
The manufacturing of pharmaceutical and medical devices is subject to extraordinarily stringent quality
requirements that are based on internationally recognized standards. Compliance with these requirements at Bayer is regularly audited by internal experts, regulatory authorities and external consultants.
online annex: 3-7.2-1
Quality standards are developed on the one hand according to regulatory requirements, approvals
and authorizations, and relevant standards of nongovernmental organizations and industry associations, and on the other hand according to customer expectations. These requirements are evaluated
by HealthCare and integrated into an internal quality management (qm) system that is based on international standards of the iso (e.g. iso 9001 and iso 13485) and the ich (International Conference
on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use), as
well as on rules for good working practice (GxP) in the development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals (e.g. Good Manufacturing Practices (gmp), Good Distribution Practices (gdp) and Good Clinical
Practices (gcp)). With the help of our qm system, we effectively and transparently implement and
manage the quality control processes and responsibilities according to established, documented and
binding procedures and methods. The goal is to ensure the quality of our products throughout their
entire life cycle and safeguard the value chain over the long term.
INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
HealthCare continuously invests in its global production network in order to ensure security of supply,
provide the necessary capacities and satisfy regulatory requirements. Further production capacities for
the manufacture of hemophilia A products are being established at the Wuppertal and Leverkusen sites
through the biggest current capital expenditure program with a total volume of more than ‚Ç¨500 million.
Another major project with a volume of some ‚Ç¨100 million is aimed at expanding production capacities
in Beijing, China.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Our CropScience products are manufactured according to high quality standards based on iso 9001, to
which more than 80% of CropScience production sites are certified. The compliance of the production
processes and registered product specifications is regularly monitored by external auditors. All our
products are reviewed and registered by the national authorities in the various countries, and thus fulfill
the respective requirements with regard to quality and user safety.
INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
We invest continuously in our global production network in order to generate capacities for new products and technologies and to improve manufacturing processes. We plan to significantly increase our
capital investment to meet the steadily rising demand. We intend to invest approximately ‚Ç¨2.4 billion in
property, plant and equipment between 2013 and 2016.
The construction of a new crop protection facility for the production of methane phosphorous acid ester
(mpe), an important precursor for the active ingredient glufosinate-ammonium, commenced at the
Knapsack site. The capital expenditure volume is more than ‚Ç¨150 million. In September 2015, we expanded our capacity for oilseed rape / canola through the construction of a new production site in Monheim, Germany.
COVESTRO
Covestro operates a large number of locations worldwide, including eight world-scale production sites.
The company also maintains specialized technical centers around the world that offer customers individually tailored solutions and that are designed for regional supply. Covestro thus guarantees not just a
global presence, but also above all customer centricity with short supply times and flexible service. At
these production sites Covestro pursues the ambitious goal of assuming and further expanding its leading position in the future, too, with regard to production volume, quality, efficiency and safety. Innovative and environmentally friendly production processes are employed as a result of the continuous technological improvement of our facilities. The selectively backwards-integrated production process enables Covestro to procure key raw materials such as chlorine and propylene oxide from within the company or through joint ventures so as to reduce the dependency on external supply sources.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Covestro applies very high standards for the quality of the raw materials it uses and their further processing into high-tech plastics and polymer precursors. A quality management system was implemented
for this purpose that is certified to the international standard iso 9001. In terms of total energy consumption, over 99.97% of the reporting production and nonproduction sites of Covestro worldwide are
certified. This is regularly monitored by internal and external auditors.
INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
To safeguard competitiveness, Covestro continuously invests in a global production network so as to
maintain the production facilities and their infrastructure, optimize production processes and, in the
case of profitable growth prospects, appropriately expand capacities. Due to the significant expansion
of capacities in recent years, Covestro plans to invest less through 2020 and focus on maintaining and
optimizing existing production facilities.

7.3 Logistics
Logistics at Bayer does not just involve the transport, handling or warehousing of goods. On the contrary, it comprises the entire planning, steering, coordination, implementation and monitoring of all
internal and intercompany flows of goods and the related information. Not only are individual business
functions combined into process chains, all processes are integrated ‚Äì from the procurement of raw
materials to the sale to end users. We work continuously to develop efficient and environmentally
friendly logistics concepts with the goal of reducing transport and storage complexity.
The safe transport of our materials and products is very important to Bayer. With this objective in mind,
we have installed management systems and directives with global validity, implemented an agile corporate structure and carefully selected contracted logistics services suppliers. You can find out more in
Chapter 9 ‚ÄúSafety.‚Äù
Concrete production and logistics planning depends on the products to be transported and the resulting
specific requirements. Logistics processes are therefore decentrally organized at Bayer. Each subgroup
maintains its own logistics units to account for the demands of different business models.
HEALTHCARE
Among other activities, the internal Product Supply organization steers all logistics services at
HealthCare across divisions ‚Äì from suppliers to the company‚Äôs own sites, within the production network
and from the company to its customers. This also includes warehouse and transport management and
the steering of supplier-, production- and customer-specific material streams. HealthCare both utilizes
internal capacities and employs external logistics partners to meet its storage and transport needs.
Warehouse sites and transport flows are established and continuously optimized accordingly. Service,
quality and costs are continuously monitored according to corresponding guidelines and indicators.
The means of transport is generally selected in a standardized process between the production site and
the recipient country, with consideration given to demand, costs and environmental aspects. These
aspects also serve to continually optimize transport processes. To this end, hubs are established in the
distribution network, planning processes are optimized and air transport reduced. These globally
steered measures are supported by greater standardization and transparency along the supply chain.

See Chapter 9

108

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
7. Procurement, Production, Logistics, Distribution

CROPSCIENCE
CropScience manages the transport and storage of products through a multi-stage system that is
aligned to production and distribution. Subsequent to production, active ingredients are distributed to a
global network of specialized warehouses and then forwarded to our regional formulation and filling
sites for further processing depending on current demand. The finished products manufactured there
are then transferred to local distribution warehouses in the respective destination countries where the
products are stored, commissioned after release and shipped to customers. The logistics process at
Seeds encompasses the various stages of production all the way to ready-to-sell seed, which is distributed to customers via local distribution warehouses.
CropScience generally deploys trucks for land transportation, while container ships are primarily used
for overseas traffic. Air freight is only selected in exceptional cases, and accounts for less than 1% of
the transport volume.
COVESTRO
At Covestro, logistics in the regions are centrally organized in Supply Chain Centers. Transport is handled by logistics service suppliers that are selected according to stringent safety, environmental and
quality criteria. The preferred mode of transport is by rail or intermodal ‚Äì in other words employing a
combination of road, rail and water transport. This increases energy efficiency and reduces co2 emissions. Customers are supplied from close-to-production warehouses, wherever transport times and
supply security allow this. In the case of longer distances, goods are temporarily stored in regional
distribution centers and then dispatched at short notice. Logistics are steered according to indicatorbased management that is aligned toward safety, environmental and supply security aspects.

7.4 Distribution
Bayer markets its products worldwide through a market- and customer-specific distribution network.
The marketing and distribution units play a key role in communicating to customers the benefits and
advantages of our high-quality products and services. Our distribution activities are geared toward the
long-term retention of existing customers and the acquisition of new clients. In this connection, we offer
smooth business processing from ordering to delivery in adequate time. Responsible conduct is also a
top priority for Bayer in marketing and distribution. The necessary rules of conduct, which do not permit legal violations in marketing, are established in our Group Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy.
This Group regulation and the respective training programs are implemented decentrally in the subgroups. A high level of customer satisfaction is essential for the long-term success of our business. We
therefore systematically analyze both the needs and satisfaction of, as well as complaints voiced by, our
customers, and thus foster partnership-based cooperation and dialogue with them.
HEALTHCARE
Our pharmaceutical products are primarily distributed through wholesalers, pharmacies and hospitals.
Co-promotion and co-marketing agreements serve to optimize our distribution network.
Consumer Care‚Äôs products are generally sold in pharmacies, with supermarket chains and other large
retailers also playing a significant role in certain important markets such as the United States. The contrast agents and medical equipment of our Medical Care Division are marketed to radiologists, cardiologists and other specialists in medical imaging in hospitals and out-patient clinical sites through a global
direct sales organization, supplemented in some cases by local distributors. Depending on local regulatory frameworks, we market our animal health products through veterinarians and other distribution
channels such as pharmacies or retail stores.

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES IN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
In the development, sale and marketing of its products, HealthCare does not tolerate bribery or any other
form of improper exertion of influence on our business partners. Furthermore, Bayer is committed to
ethical advertising and communication for all its products and services. Our minimum standards are
derived from three basic sources: laws and other statutory regulations, industry codes and internal rules.
The marketing and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are strictly regulated and subject to relevant laws that we are committed to observing. Also applicable at the global or regional levels
are industry codes adopted by associations of the pharmaceuticals, medical devices and animal health
industries. In many countries, furthermore, these standards are further concretized by local codes ‚Äì all
of which apply to prescription pharmaceuticals and many of which additionally apply to nonprescription
medicines.
online annex: 3-7.4-1
All codes of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (ifpma)
serve as a binding global minimum global standard for all products marketed by HealthCare. In addition, Bayer observes the codes of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (efpia) for dealings with health care professionals and patient organizations. The who‚Äôs Ethical
Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion, together with national ethical standards that are usually enshrined in industry codes at the local level, represent the minimum global standard for the advertising of pharmaceutical products at HealthCare. All the aforementioned codes contain provisions governing, among other issues, advertising material standards, the distribution of samples, cooperation
with members of medical and pharmaceutical specialist groups in connection with speaker and consultancy contracts, and scientific studies. Adherence to these codes is designed to ensure the independence of both health care professionals and patient organizations. Based on the new efpia transparency code and beginning in June 2016 at the latest, furthermore, Bayer will disclose any grants to
health care professionals and organizations annually for the preceding calendar year.
The most important Bayer Group regulation in this connection is our Anti-Corruption Procedure, which
establishes minimum global standards on this topic for the entire company. HealthCare has summarized
the key requirements and the minimum global standard for compliant and ethical conduct in the AntiCorruption Compliance Manual, which applies worldwide in all divisions. The main principles for ethically and legally acceptable advertising for pharmaceuticals and medical devices are also set out in an
internal HealthCare directive. The goal of these directives is to help HealthCare employees to always act
in compliance with all applicable regulations. Should several regulations be relevant, HealthCare principally applies the more stringent standards.
Training measures on product-related communication and anti-corruption are fundamental elements of
the system at Bayer. They are directed toward certain employee groups and are tailored to account for
the special risks these employees are exposed to. The principles presented in these training courses
provide an overview of globally applicable minimum requirements for cooperation with key stakeholders
of HealthCare, such as physicians, hospitals or patient organizations. The courses not only explain general compliance principles but also give specific instructions in relation to nonreciprocal benefits and
the exchange of services with health care professionals.
As part of our compliance management system, we register and investigate any suspected violation of
our responsible marketing principles. This applies to complaints both from within the company and as
notified to us from outside.

CUSTOMER DIALOGUE
A keen understanding of manifold customer needs is especially important if HealthCare‚Äôs products are
to be successful in the market. Our customers include patients, physicians, caretakers, health policy
decision-makers and opinion leaders, partners from research and development, and health care payers.
Due to the stark distinctions between these groups, the individual HealthCare divisions take specific
steps to enter into dialogue with customers and measure their satisfaction.
Different legal requirements apply for prescription medicines than for nonprescription or medical devices. This makes the conditions under which customer satisfaction data are gathered in the health
sector correspondingly complex. For example, it is not permitted to directly survey patients about the
effects and side effects of prescription medicines. HealthCare therefore conducts primary market and
data research in this area.
online annex: 3-7.4-2
We use market research projects to identify the needs of the various customer groups and thus further strengthen customer orientation at Pharmaceuticals. We also carry out systematic internet analyses that give us a better understanding of our stakeholders‚Äô opinions, interests and networks. To
measure customer satisfaction, Pharmaceuticals conducts international surveys of its customer
groups according to therapeutic areas. The results of the studies are regularly integrated into brand
planning. To continuously optimize customer service, moreover, we support our medical sales force
through product- and country-specific training courses.
Following the success of pilot projects in key markets, Consumer Care in 2015 began introducing its
excellence program to improve customer orientation worldwide. The program is designed to identify
examples of best practices in the areas of market launch strategies, distribution and trading. It has
already been successfully implemented in 13 countries, and others will follow in 2016.
Animal Health also conducts studies on customer satisfaction and customer retention, applying varying methods according to the respective market segment. From studies that track long-term customer behavior, performance indicators are developed that in turn are used to measure customer satisfaction.
Complaints, customer services for orders, product and delivery information, information on health
care topics or the handling of general inquiries pertaining to HealthCare are processed by the relevant business units and country organizations. The respective contact information is available online.
As the Bayer Group is headquartered in Germany, HealthCare operates a customer service center in
that country with a quality management system certified to iso 9001:2008.
CROPSCIENCE
DISTRIBUTION
CropScience markets its products in more than 120 countries. We market our crop protection products
mainly through wholesalers or directly through retailers. We also sell products directly to customers in
selected markets where market conditions require this mode of distribution.
Distribution activities for seeds are focused on the crops cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice, soybeans and
vegetables from our own research laboratories and breeding facilities. In our core crops, we have
achieved strong market positions and are internationally represented. Our seeds are sold to growers,
seedling companies, specialist retailers and the processing industry. Plant traits developed using modern breeding methods are either incorporated into our own seed varieties or licensed to other seed
companies.

111

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
7. Procurement, Production, Logistics, Distribution

The Environmental Science products are mainly sold through wholesalers and specialist retailers. We
market our range of pest and weed control products to professional users in the green industry (including public parks and golf courses), forestry, industrial vegetation management and professional pest
control. In the area of public health, an example being vector control to combat malaria and dengue
fever, much of our business is transacted in response to tendering by government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. We also offer pest control and plant care products to private customers in
the home and garden sector.
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES IN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
CropScience follows the guidelines of its Product Stewardship Policy with regard to the distribution and
use of its crop protection products. This policy, which also satisfies the requirements of the Group Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy, is based on the International Code of Conduct issued by the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (fao). Training materials to explain this Group policy have been distributed throughout the global organization and are available to the employees on the
Bayer intranet.
online annex: 3-7.4-3
Responsible business practices in marketing and sales are addressed at CropScience in compliance
training courses and are also an integral element of marketing and sales excellence training
measures. In 2015, we trained a total of 600 (2014: 2,400) CropScience employees worldwide in
three- and one-day training courses.
CUSTOMER DIALOGUE
CropScience sees tremendous value in the satisfaction of its customers. Our goal is to establish longterm customer relationships that ensure the business success and meet the expectations of both parties.
We strive to fulfill the high expectations of our customers through targeted communication, smooth
business processing and effective complaint management. We regularly determine these expectations
through our commercial excellence activities so that we can offer our customers tailored solutions. In
addition to the customer surveys we conduct through our country organizations every two years according to a standardized process, we analyze all channels of interaction with our customers. We use the
findings of these analyses to align our distribution and marketing processes around the world to the
respective customer needs. In general, we aim to make our dialogue with customers more target groupand region-specific and to continuously improve it. We improve our customer processes in part with the
help of a customer relationship management database that is now used in more than 60 of our country
organizations. We assess our performance using a system of qualitative and quantitative indicators.
CropScience is also intensifying its direct cooperation with farmers through the Bayer Forward Farming
initiative. Our solutions for sustainable agriculture in practice are demonstrated at Bayer ForwardFarms.
The first farms have been established in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands, and further
collaborations are being prepared in Spain and Brazil. CropScience will successively expand this type of
cooperation worldwide.
COVESTRO
DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER DIALOGUE
Covestro‚Äôs products are mainly supplied to the automotive and transportation, construction, wood processing and furniture, and electrical / electronics industries. Other customer industries are the sports
and leisure, cosmetics and health care sectors, as well as the chemical industry.
Covestro markets its products mostly through regional and local distribution channels. Here three regional Supply Chain Centers serve as the central link to the customer. Covestro makes use of ecommerce platforms and other channels for order processing. Customer satisfaction is systematically
analyzed on a global basis, enabling the development of improvement measures.

GRI
G4-26

112

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
8. Product Stewardship

online annex: 3-7.4-4
The Supply Chain Centers pool all information streams from order acceptance to dispatch planning,
delivery and complaint acceptance in the Europe / Middle East / Africa/Latin America, North America
and Asia / Pacific regions. This ensures a high level of expertise particularly in order management
and in transaction, supply chain and logistics solutions. Using the ‚ÄúOrder@Covestro‚Äù online information platform, customers can at any time place orders, call up material safety data sheets and
track the status of their orders.
Covestro‚Äôs highest quality objective is faultlessness so as to attain a high level of customer satisfaction. To systematically increase customer satisfaction and ensure optimal quality of service, complaints registered in the global management system and by the individual business units are regularly evaluated. Customer evaluations are also analyzed in detail. Through dialogue with internal stakeholders, preventive and corrective measures are undertaken to further increase quality and customer
satisfaction while at the same time lowering the error rate and thus also the incidence of complaints.
In 2015, for example, a total of 5,178 complaints by around 2,088 customers were registered worldwide. This yields a rate of 7.61 complaints per 1,000 deliveries, about the same as in 2014 (7.75
complaints per 1,000 deliveries).
Covestro also works with trading houses and local distributors who are responsible for business with
small customers. Major customers with global operations are serviced directly by key account managers.
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES IN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
In the marketing of its products, Covestro also takes into account all the requirements of the Bayer
Group‚Äôs Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy. The importance of observing antitrust law and preventing corruption is regularly emphasized in training programs, internal communications and discussions
with management. In 2015, training focused on export control. Around 4,980 Covestro managerial
employees took part in web-based compliance training courses and supplementary target grouporiented, on-site training sessions.

8. Product Stewardship
Our products and services are designed to benefit people and improve their quality of life. We consider
product stewardship to mean that our products are safe for people, animals and the environment when
properly used. This is a key factor in creating lasting trust in our products and maintaining our business
foundation over the long term.
All substances and finished products undergo extensive testing and evaluation to ensure a high degree
of safety. We assess the possible health and environmental risks of a product along the entire value
chain ‚Äì starting with research and development and continuing through production, marketing and use
by the customer through to disposal. From this we derive suitable steps to mitigate risks based on the
observation of legal requirements and internal standards that go beyond these.
Bayer has put in place suitable directives and management systems for the implementation of regulatory and voluntary product stewardship requirements that are steered by our hseq (health, safety, environmental protection and quality) departments. These efforts are underscored by the Bayer Group‚Äôs
target of completing the assessment of the hazard potential of all substances (>99%) used in quantities
exceeding one metric ton per annum by 2020.
IMPLEMENTING STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
Extensive legal regulations apply to all products manufactured by Bayer. Chemical substances are
subject to the European chemicals regulation reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and the clp regulation (Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of
Substances and Mixtures). The classification and labeling of chemicals is intended to clearly inform
employees and consumers in the European Union about the risks associated with chemicals.

113

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
8. Product Stewardship

online annex: 3-8-1
The registration obligation under reach applies irrespective of marketing activities for all substances
that we produce or import in quantities of more than one metric ton. There is also an authorization
procedure that limits the use of particularly hazardous substances or can lead to their replacement or
ban. To fulfil the complex requirements of reach, we have approved Group-wide and subgroupspecific regulations. Already registered substances are also regularly evaluated by the authorities.
For Bayer substances this can result in additional testing requirements, new risk management
measures or inclusion in the reach authorization procedure. This is indeed the case for some Bayer
substances. The authorities enforce the implementation of reach through regular inspections. So far
none of the inspections at Bayer has resulted in complaints. As we also use many substances from
other manufacturers, we maintain close contacts with our suppliers and ensure that they reassure
conformity with reach for the substances they supply.
In the European Union, the Globally Harmonized System (ghs) for the classification and labeling of
chemicals is implemented through the clp regulation. The purpose of the ghs is to achieve a globally standardized system for classifying chemicals and labeling them appropriately on packaging and
in material safety data sheets. Bayer assesses all its marketed products and implements the ghs
worldwide.
Before any product is introduced to the market, we assess it under this stringent process to determine
whether it is safe for people, animals and the environment.
Furthermore, the end products from our Life Science units ‚Äì such as pharmaceuticals, crop protection
products and biocides ‚Äì are subject to specific approval / authorization procedures.
VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT
Since 1994, Bayer has supported the voluntary Responsible Care‚Ñ¢ initiative of the chemical industry,
which was globalized in 2006 with the introduction of the Responsible Care‚Ñ¢ Global Charter. We cover
all main elements of the charter at all Group sites with our hseq management systems and activities. We
are also actively involved in the further development of scientific risk assessment through our work in
associations and initiatives.

International associations such as the European and international chemical industry associations
(cefic,‡Øóicca) and the oecd (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), as well as initiatives such as ecetoc (European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals) and the
epaa (European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing), work to evolve the scientific assessment of chemicals, develop new test methods and oversee the implementation of statutory
regulations. Bayer actively supports these efforts through its activities in the associations. We are also involved in the icca Long-Range Research Initiative, for example, and endorse the goals of the
who and e.u. action plans for improving health and environmental protection. We also support the
Global Product Strategy (gps), a voluntary commitment of the chemical industry initiated by the International Council of Chemical Associations (icca). Its objective is to improve knowledge about
chemical products, especially in Emerging Markets and developing countries, and thus increase safety in the handling of these products.
We concern ourselves intensively with our substances‚Äô properties and regularly evaluate them already at
the research and development stage. In application of the precautionary principle, the development of
substances with undesirable properties is discontinued.
online annex: 3-8-3
We accept the precautionary principle as explained in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration of the United Nations and communiqu√© com (2000) 1 of the European Commission as a possible consumer protection and risk management tool. It is applied whenever there is no final scientific certainty in a given area and evidence also exists that people or the environment could suffer significant or irreversible damage that must be rectified. There should not be a unilateral focus on hazard potential, but rather a balanced risk-benefit evaluation.

To assess the effects of our products, especially on human health, but also on nature and the environment, animal studies are legally required. Wherever possible, we use existing data or approved alternative test methods to avoid animal studies. We set high animal welfare standards in this regard. For more
information, see the section ‚ÄúFocusing on Animal Welfare.‚Äù

Group target 2020:
assessment of the
hazard potential of all
substances > 1 metric
ton p.a.
See also Chapter
1.4 for Group target

The safe handling of chemicals is a top priority in the manufacture of our products (see also Chapter 9).
In Europe we operate under strict legal requirements. We voluntarily apply comparable standards around
the world, independent of the respective national legislation. In this way we exceed statutory requirements and are ensuring that substance assessments comparable to those established under reach will
also be applied at Bayer sites that are not subject to this European regulation. How we aim to realize this
target is established in our Bayer Group Regulation ‚ÄúSubstance Information and Availability.‚Äù
To ensure the safe handling of chemicals, risk assessments are carried out applying recognized scientific methods such as the Guidance on Information Requirements and Chemical Safety Assessment of
the echa (European Chemicals Agency).
Should the assessment or new findings reveal that it is not safe to use a certain chemical, we take the
steps to mitigate risks. We support our customers in the safe handling and use of our products through
close, trust-based cooperation. Bayer compiles material safety data sheets for all products regardless of
whether or not they are legally required. All end consumer products come with suitable packaging
information, an example being package inserts for pharmaceuticals.
online annex: 3-8-4
Risk mitigation measures can range from revised application recommendations through the withdrawal of support for a certain application to the substitution of a substance. In this case, a replacement substance must be sought that is economically and technically feasible. The substitution of
chemicals is basically a continuous task of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to obtain new
or substantially improved products and processes. This is integral to our commitment to Responsible
Care.
Material safety data sheets are the central means of communication for safety-relevant information
about substances and mixtures in the supply chain. Targeting professional users, they contain information on the substance‚Äôs properties and on the safe use of the substance or mixture. In addition,
technical information is provided for professional use.
In accordance with the respective product safety and information obligations, all subgroups compile
product information ‚Äì regardless of whether it is for raw materials, intermediates or end products. To
ensure worldwide access to this information, Bayer uses appropriate it systems, including those for
product labeling. This data compilation is updated accordingly whenever new legal requirements are
established.
Another important element of our product stewardship is the monitoring of all products that are
already on the market. We have established processes in all subgroups aimed at addressing inquiries on
product safety or problems with our products. This feedback and these experiences are systematically
accounted for in our assessment of risks, which also covers substances that are regarded as potentially
high-risk by regulatory authorities and independent institutions.

115

8. Product Stewardship

In all subgroups, we examine additional steps that go beyond the legally required disposal
specifications.
PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP IN THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
Biotechnological methods are used for product development in our Pharmaceuticals and Crop Protection businesses.
Biotechnology has already gained significant importance in pharmaceutical product development. The
HealthCare products Betaferon‚Ñ¢ / Betaseron‚Ñ¢, Eylea‚Ñ¢ and Kogenate‚Ñ¢ are manufactured by a biotechnological process. Further biotechnologically manufactured active ingredients are undergoing clinical
development.
Plant biotechnology can improve crop yields, yield security and the stress tolerance of plants through
both genetic engineering and conventional breeding methods but with the same input of resources.
Safety is Bayer‚Äôs top priority in the use of biotechnology, too. Beyond our observance of all relevant
legal provisions, we have formulated a Bayer Group Regulation ‚ÄúPosition on the Responsible Use of
Gene Technology‚Äù and specific regulations for HealthCare and CropScience. We provide our stakeholders with comprehensive, transparent and reliable information about our products and services in accordance with our Bayer Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy.
online annex: 3-8-5
HealthCare has established strict safety measures for handling biological agents in research,
development and production in its ‚ÄúBiological Safety‚Äù regulation and its ‚ÄúRequirements for the safe
handling of biological agents‚Äù procedure.
CropScience has included the responsible measures taken when utilizing plant biotechnology in both
the Product Stewardship Policy and the Seeds Stewardship Directive. CropScience maintained its focus on product stewardship for customers both within and outside the company through its activities
in the context of the industry‚Äôs Excellence Through Stewardship Program (ets). Audits by etscertified auditors are required to maintain our ets membership, and in 2015 CropScience successfully completed audits of its operations in Brazil and Argentina which included for the first time the new
ets Insect Resistance Management best practices for biotechnology-derived plant products.
FOCUSING ON ANIMAL WELFARE
Animal studies are legally required and essential from a scientific viewpoint to assess the safety and
efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other chemical compounds. We aim to minimize the use of study animals and to employ replacement and complementary methods wherever possible.
In our handling of animals, we respect all legal requirements pertaining to animal welfare. Bayer‚Äôs
principles on animal welfare and animal studies apply in countries without special animal welfare
legislation, and in the case of external studies compliance with these guidelines is contractually agreed.
Bayer‚Äôs in-house Global Animal Welfare Committee ‚Äì comprised of the animal welfare officers at our
research sites and further Bayer experts ‚Äì monitors compliance with our principles on animal welfare
and animal studies within the Bayer Group and in external studies. It defines supplementary standards
that are essential for carrying out animal studies in the Bayer Group.
Bayer ensures that international and national laws and directives are strictly observed during all animal
studies. This is verified by both regulatory authorities and internal audits. Bayer additionally deploys its
own animal welfare experts at all sites at which animal studies are carried out.

See Chapter 10.5

116

animalstudies.
bayer.com

Our principles also apply to both the research institutes we commission and our suppliers, whose
compliance with our animal welfare requirements we regularly monitor. The information provided in
supplier self-evaluations is verified through on-site audits. Current figures and further information are
available on our website.
online annex: 3-8-6
The Global Animal Welfare Committee has defined performance criteria. Each year we analyze the
development of animal numbers, the distribution according to species, the burden placed on our test
animals and the ratio of regulatorily required studies to exploratory studies, and discuss possible
steps in accordance with the 3rs principle (replace, reduce, refine). We are thus able to demonstrate
that since 2005 the number of study animals used per ‚Ç¨1 million research budget (including animals
in Bayer studies performed by contract research organizations) has declined from 96 animals to
around 31 animals in 2015.
We continuously update our internal database, which combines all information about our own animal
studies and the evaluation of our cooperation partners and makes it available to all employees in this
area. All subgroups apply clear rules to ensure that animal welfare standards are comprehensively
observed by our partners.
Bayer also participates in several European consortia that aim to reduce the number of animal studies or improve their validity, such as the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal
Testing (epaa). HealthCare is involved in the leadership of the eTOX project and the marcar and
k4dd projects of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (imi). Bayer is a member of the scientific advisory boards of the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ecetoc) and the
Long Range Research Initiative (lri). In Germany, we support the Foundation for the Promotion of
Alternate and Complementary Methods to Reduce Animal Testing (set).
PROTECTION AGAINST PRODUCT COUNTERFEITING
Counterfeit medicines and crop protection products harbor substantial risks for patients and consumers.
Product counterfeiting is a global problem that can only be addressed internationally through a joint
approach by industry, associations, governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Bayer
consistently advocates the strengthening and expansion of existing laws and provisions aimed at the
identification and confiscation of illegal products. We try to protect patients and our products through
extensive measures of our own.

www.bayer.com/
beware-ofcounterfeits

online annex: 3-8-7
The focus of HealthCare‚Äôs activities is on raising awareness and providing information to ensure the
clear identification of our original products, as well as on legal steps aimed at minimizing illegal
trade. Through our ‚ÄúBeware of Counterfeits‚Äù campaign, we inform patients on the internet about the
risks of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and provide patients with tips on how they can protect themselves. Through the use of various technological means in production, we constantly strive to ensure
that patients, too, can distinguish between original and counterfeit products.
We also support the establishment of a Europe-wide system for the identification of original pharmaceuticals that satisfies the requirements of the e.u. Falsified Medicine Directive. In addition, Bayer
participates in the Pharmaceutical Industry Initiative to Combat Crime (piicc) of Interpol to counteract pharmaceutical counterfeiting through global prosecution and the elimination of related criminal
networks. We participate in the SecurPharm initiative in Germany. Since 2015, Bayer has contributed
its expertise to a research project (ALPhA) supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research to prevent the sale of counterfeit pharmaceuticals on the internet.

www.illegal
pesticides.eu/

For crop protection products, too, a worldwide increase in the trade of counterfeit and illegal products can be observed. According to a study conducted in 2015 on behalf of the European Commission, such products account for an average of 10% of the total market across all e.u. member states.
To protect against the import of counterfeit and illegal crop protection products into the e.u., CropScience intensively advocates the uniform interpretation and implementation of existing e.u. regulations in all e.u. member states. In addition to supporting regulatory authorities with the identification

117

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
8. Product Stewardship

of counterfeit products through chemical analysis, we conduct our own inspections in the market and
also actively support initiatives by associations.
To educate about the potential dangers and risks of counterfeit and illegal crop protection products,
we provide information material and train customers, dealers, farmers and regulatory authorities as
part of our product stewardship programs. We document all indications of suspicious and potentially
counterfeit or illegal CropScience products in an established, systematic process. CropScience‚Äôs efforts yield measurable results: in 2015, for example, we successfully asserted our patent protection
rights against an illegal Chinese producer. In Brazil, counterfeit CropScience products with a market
value in the double-digit million range were confiscated.

8.1 HealthCare
BENEFIT-RISK MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL DEVICES
Patient safety is Bayer‚Äôs top priority. HealthCare continuously assesses the medical benefit-risk balance
of its medicinal products and medical devices throughout their entire product life cycle. The efficacy,
safety and tolerability of pharmaceuticals and their behavior in the body are studied in Phases i-iii of
preclinical and clinical development. The documentation submitted to the regulatory authorities contains the results of these studies and comprehensive information on the product‚Äôs benefit-risk assessment. Marketing authorization is only granted for a product if it satisfies the safety requirements of the
health and regulatory authorities.
Following registration, HealthCare continues to compile safety-relevant information in an internal
pharmacovigilance database. This information is continuously evaluated and the risk-benefit balance
regularly assessed by medical experts in the Global Pharmacovigilance Department. In this process,
Bayer works closely with the responsible regulatory and supervisory authorities at the international and
national levels. These include the u.s. Food and Drug Administration (fda), the European Medicines
Agency (ema) and Germany‚Äôs Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM).
Additional safety-relevant information is also compiled using Post-Authorization Safety Studies (pass)
conducted after approval. Protocols and summaries of pass results are entered into the pass registry in
compliance with e.u. pharmacovigilance legislation.
online annex: 3-8.1-1
HealthCare has a global pharmaceutical monitoring system in which experts from various disciplines
work together in functional safety management teams (smts). These teams jointly evaluate the available benefit and safety data and other relevant product information so as to identify potential safety
concerns at an early stage or detect possible changes in the benefit-risk ratio. In addition to internally compiled safety data from clinical trials, post-marketing studies and ad hoc information on adverse
side effects, the company‚Äôs experts conduct assessments using external databases and the information contained in scientific publications. smts produce detailed safety risk management plans.
These plans are updated as soon as relevant new benefit-risk data become available. Implementation
of risk mitigation activities is coordinated by local smts in the country organizations. All processes
are documented, regularly updated and integrated into a quality management system.

118

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
8. Product Stewardship

Should risks be identified during this assessment, Bayer immediately undertakes suitable steps to safeguard the health of patients ‚Äì such as updating product information for patients and physicians. Further
elements of risk mitigation programs can include targeted information, e.g. patient education brochures
and training measures for medical specialists, as well as direct communication with medical experts
(Direct Healthcare Professional Communication, dhpc) and even product withdrawals if necessary.
These measures are coordinated with the competent authorities.

See Chapter 7.2

HealthCare‚Äôs quality and risk management functions also make further contributions to increased safety.
We examine external and internal quality assurance requirements for our products through systematic
internal audits ‚Äì not just in research and development, but also in production. These audits also cover
both institutes sub-contracted by us and our suppliers. More information on our quality management
can be found in Chapter 7.2 ‚ÄúProduction.‚Äù
In line with the statutory requirements, strict safety and quality standards also apply to animal health
products. Within the scope of the approval / authorization procedures, Animal Health also carries out
studies in order to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of its products.
ANALYSIS OF RESIDUES OF PHARMACEUTICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
Active pharmaceutical ingredients can enter the environment, either through human or livestock excreta, improper disposal of unused medicines or during the production process. HealthCare carries out
ecotoxicological investigations of the environmental behavior of residues and degradation products to
assess the potential environmental impact of our pharmaceutical products. In accordance with applicable law regarding human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, an environmental risk assessment takes place
for all active ingredients for which the company is targeting an approval procedure in Europe or the
United States. Here it must be examined whether significant risks may arise for the environment when
the pharmaceuticals are used as instructed.
Based on currently available information derived from measurements carried out by authorities and
scientific institutes, the existing concentrations of individual active pharmaceutical ingredients from
human or veterinary medicines in drinking water do not have any adverse effects on human health. This
subject is dealt with in particular by a who report on pharmaceuticals in drinking water published in
2012 that comes to the conclusion that traceable effects on human health through the current extent of
exposure via drinking water are highly improbable. This estimation corresponds with the studies by
national authorities and institutes known to us.
In the production of our pharmaceuticals, internal company wastewater threshold values ensure that no
risk to the environment results from the release of traces of active ingredients in wastewater from our
production sites. All HealthCare production sites worldwide are evaluated with regard to these threshold
values. Site-specific measures aimed at a further reduction are taken should it not be possible to observe these standards over the long term. This includes substance-specific measures such as filtration,
evaporation, oxidation, incineration or biological clarification in wastewater treatment plants.
online annex: 3-8.1-2
Within the scope of our product stewardship, we actively participate in research projects
aimed at further studying pharmaceutical residues in the environment and introducing targeted measures to prevent them.
Since 2015, we have coordinated the ‚ÄúIntelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the
Environment‚Äù project in Europe, which seeks new ways to improve environmental risk assessment. To this end, information from toxicological studies, pharmacological modes of action and computer-based models are analyzed with the goal of developing models and methods for determining possible environmental risks of pharmaceutical substances in early development stages and prioritizing for further environmental assessment existing substances that
previously have not been evaluated.
Bayer was represented on the Scientific Advisory Board of noPILLS, an e.u.-sponsored cooperation project completed in 2015 and involving several European countries with the goal of
reducing pharmaceutical residues in water. The project demonstrated that a reduction in

119

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
8. Product Stewardship

pharmaceutical residues in water can only be achieved through cooperation between numerous parties. Educating consumers on the correct disposal of pharmaceuticals, improving
wastewater treatment technology and the collection of excreta in connection with certain medicines proved to be effective approaches for achieving this objective.
In Germany, HealthCare participates in the ‚ÄúRisk Management of Emerging Compounds and
Pathogens in the Water Cycle‚Äù initiative sponsored by the German Ministry for Education and
Research. HealthCare is a member of the steering committee. The ‚Äúsauber+‚Äù (‚ÄúClean+‚Äù) project, which is part of this initiative, deals with the study of wastewater from health care industry facilities that is contaminated with active pharmaceutical ingredients and disease pathogens. Here it was determined that these emissions are not higher on average than those from
private households. The reduction of pharmaceutical emissions generally depends on the individual active ingredients and should pursue a holistic approach. HealthCare was a member of
the Stakeholder Advisory Board of that project, which was concluded in 2015.

8.2 CropScience
FOCUSING ON PRODUCT SAFETY
Before crop protection products and technologies can be introduced to the market, they must demonstrate that they are harmless to people and animals and can be used without causing unjustifiable burden on the environment. For this they require official authorization, which is regulated by numerous
international and national laws and provisions. The requirements for marketing authorization, particularly as pertains to the environment, have risen sharply in recent years with the goal of further increasing product safety and minimizing potential risks. CropScience satisfies all the regulatory requirements
of the countries in which our products are sold to protect crops.
Product safety and environmental compatibility of crop protection products and technologies play a
central role in development. CropScience examines the products during the development phase in
stringent tests that are required by law. The tests evaluate a product‚Äôs mode of action, its ecotoxicological and toxicological properties and potential remaining trace concentrations in the plants or the environment following proper application. Each new crop protection active ingredient and each new technology must undergo several years of studies and testing to ensure that it can be applied effectively and
that its use is safe for people, animals and the environment.
It takes roughly 10 years for a crop protection product or technology to complete the entire development process including all studies and be launched onto the market. But our product stewardship does
not end there. CropScience also observes the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management
of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (fao). The principles of this code cover the
entire life cycle of a product or technology, from its development to its application and beyond. We
implement all major aspects of responsible product handling in our Product Stewardship Program,
which is based on the principles of our Product Stewardship Policy.
online annex: 3-8.2-1
Even beyond its core business, CropScience participates specifically in projects aimed at increased
product stewardship ‚Äì such as the Better Sugarcane Initiative, which works to promote sustainable
sugarcane cultivation, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification organization, which
is working to establish a system for certifying biomass and bioenergy. We are also a member of the
Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil Production and the Round Table for Responsible Soy (rtrs). In
2015, we signed an agreement with rtrs to support the certification of soybean production in Brazil.
In the United States, the e3 cotton sustainability program was introduced to support farmers in the
production of sustainably grown cotton, which is much in demand by retailers. Farmers who sign up
for the program commit to ensuring that the cultivation of their cotton is certified as traceable, environmentally responsible, economically viable and socially equitable.

8. Product Stewardship

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS
The application of crop protection products requires the greatest possible care. Supporting our customers and partners in the proper and safe handling of our seed and crop protection products is therefore a
focus of our product stewardship. In this connection, we offer targeted training measures worldwide
particularly for farmers and dealers that are designed to promote the responsible handling of our products and thus improve safety for users, the environment and consumers. These training measures are
carried out in all countries in which our products are sold. Responsibility for their implementation lies
with the country organizations, which align their training concepts to the needs of the respective countries.
online annex: 3-8.2-2
We maintained our training activities in the Asia and Latin America regions in 2015. In India, CropScience trained farmers in good agricultural practice. We teach them how they can enhance the
growth of their produce, use crop protection products effectively and safely, and thus increase the
quality of their harvested goods. This opens up new ways of marketing their products that help
smallholder farmers in particular to gain increased profit from them.
Our AgroVida program in Latin America comprises various initiatives with which we have been continuously increasing the farmers‚Äô safety awareness and specialist expertise for more than 20 years.
Safety training offerings for farmers are an important aspect here. In 2015, for instance, we trained
more than 35,100 farmers in the Andean region and almost 30,400 farmers in the Central America
and Caribbean region (excluding Mexico). Together with the international crop protection association CropLife, we also carried out safety training measures in numerous African countries in 2015.
Our product stewardship measures also include internal employee training measures. Our Product
Stewardship Policy also provides information on all principles for the responsible handling of our
products, combined with specific instructions for use for our employees and those who work with
our products.
In addition to training activities, we produce manuals explaining the safe use and scope of protective
clothing and the correct storage and disposal of our products. These manuals are available online to our
customers and partners, an example being the ‚ÄúDressCode‚Äù containing information on optimal protective clothing for the handling of our products. They are also distributed in the aforementioned training
courses as brochures or information sheets. Furthermore, we offer farmers our support in implementing
practical steps for user and environmental protection.
Users of our products can contact CropScience through a range of communication channels should they
have complaints or feedback or wish to report any incidents. These include direct contact with our sales
staff; our hotline, which is printed on all our product packaging; and, for example, in Germany, the
‚ÄúAgrar Telefon‚Äù hotline. All incoming product complaints and incidents are locally compiled and processed by the respective CropScience experts. Entries necessitating corrective measures are additionally recorded in a global database. An internal Bayer directive governs the processing, communication
and, if necessary, implementation of corrective measures. Employee training courses also take place
regularly here as well.

121

CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
Stringent legal regulations apply to the approval and use of crop protection products. They are aimed at
protecting the environment from unwanted side effects, as every farmer‚Äôs livelihood depends on an
intact environment and fertile soil. Responsible Care is extremely important in all areas of agriculture to
minimize possible effects and the discharge of crop protection products outside of the treated crops.
Bayer believes its responsibility includes protecting the environment from emissions and optimizing the
safety of its products through extensive stewardship measures.
Protecting water from agricultural emissions and maintaining good groundwater quality are cornerstones of the responsible use of water as a natural resource. It cannot be completely ruled out in agricultural practice that substances can leach into groundwater or be emitted into flowing waters and lakes
through surface runoff. Improper disposal of residual liquids following the cleaning of spraying apparatus can also lead to discharges of crop protection products into surface water. The application of crop
protection products is subject to national water protection regulations, including in Europe the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. CropScience places particular importance on water protection
and supports agriculture in environmentally friendly land cultivation and the disposal of residual liquids
following the application of crop protection products.
online annex: 3-8.2-3
In the area of water pollution mitigation, we promote the biological remediation system Phytobac‚Ñ¢
to customers. This is intended to prevent point source discharges of crop protection active ingredients into water bodies during the disposal of residual liquids that are generated during the filling and
cleaning of spraying devices. There are already some 3,500 Phytobac‚Ñ¢ plants in Europe (primarily in
France).

www.bayer.com/
phytobac

Erosion and runoff processes on agricultural land can also lead to substance emissions into adjacent
water systems. In this context, we are collaborating with external partners on the development of a
web-based geoinformation system for water protection in agriculture. This enables the visualization
of site-related runoff / erosion risks by means of high-resolution risk maps supplemented with suitable
mitigation proposals. It is planned for this system to be used as an advisory tool for water protection
in agriculture.
Pollinator protection is another focus of our product stewardship activities. As a Life Science company
with a long tradition in agriculture and animal health, we know how important healthy bees are ‚Äì not
just as pollinators for sustainable food production and as honey producers, but also due to the key role
they play in many ecosystems throughout the world. Promoting pollinator health and sustainable agriculture is of central importance for our business activity. In our view, protecting honey bees and wild
bees is a matter that concerns society at large; maintaining their health is everyone‚Äôs responsibility.
Bayer takes its role very seriously in this regard and wants to make a contribution.
In our Bee Care Program, we coordinate and combine all Bayer activities in the area of pollinator health
and pollinator safety in order to advance the development and implementation of suitable solutions.
Within the framework of this program, we proactively approach numerous stakeholder groups ‚Äì including industry partners, scientists, farmers, beekeepers, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations and representatives of the food value chain ‚Äì to improve our networks with them, address their
questions and concerns and seek opportunities for cooperating with them in the area of pollinator
health. Bee Care Centers exist in Germany and the United States for this purpose. In 2015, furthermore,
we entered into a collaboration in the area of bee health in Latin America with the Fraunhofer Chile
Research Foundation. A global Bee Care network has now been built up.

The Bayer Bee Care Program combines our well-founded knowledge in the areas of animal health and
crop protection so as to contribute to protecting pollinator health. The objectives here are to:
‚Ä¢ Develop further solutions to promote bee health so that beekeepers can better fight pests and disease pathogens
‚Ä¢ Actively promote the bee-friendly use of our innovative solutions (products, technologies and services) and to enable involved stakeholder groups to ensure bee safety in farming and gardening
‚Ä¢ Expand and improve pollinators‚Äô food sources to help offset nutritional deficits
‚Ä¢ Openly and actively promote an honest dialogue and transparent communication on pollinator health
with all involved stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Exchange knowledge and specialist information with all stakeholder groups and institutions (beekeepers, farmers, research institutes, ngos, political decision-makers and registration authorities)
online annex: 3-8.2-4
Bee health is impacted by several factors for which Bayer pursues various solutions.
Bayer is investing in the research and development of a new form of application for products to control the Varroa mite, which scientists consider to be the biggest danger for honey bees. Bayer is also
active in setting up flowering areas that can provide pollinators with a rich food source for pollen and
nectar. The treatment of seed is an important step to protect sensitive crop seedlings from pest pressure. In the sowing of treated seed, however, small amounts of insecticide dust that is potentially
harmful to pollinators can be released. Our ‚ÄúZero Dust‚Äù project and further cooperation projects to
reduce dust emissions help to minimize the dust release.
Bayer is firmly convinced that neonicotinoids are an important insecticide class with beneficial properties. They are effective against key pests that in many regions have already developed resistances
against other substances. They are especially user-safe due to their low human toxicity. Seed treatment with neonicotinoids is an environmentally friendly application technique because it significantly reduces the likelihood that pollinators and other environmental organisms can come into contact
with crop protection products. Bayer is also convinced that neonicotinoids are safe for bees if they
are used responsibly and properly. This was confirmed by risk evaluations performed during marketing authorization reviews by the responsible authorities of countries outside Europe. In Europe,
however, Bayer products that contain two of our neonicotinoid compounds have been prohibited
since 2013 from use in crops that are attractive to bees. The European Commission has recently instructed the European Food Safety Authority (efsa) to examine all newly available data and reports
from the past two years. The results are expected for the end of 2016.
Bayer has brought the restriction on neonicotinoid use in the e.u. before the Court of Justice of the
European Union in order to clarify the legal basis of the Commission‚Äôs decision. This decision is
based on an assessment by the efsa that in turn is based on neither a validated nor an officially recognized risk assessment system. With a view to future investment decisions, the company is primarily asking that the court clarify the regulatory framework.

8.3 Covestro
The products of Covestro satisfy the most stringent of safety requirements. This does not just apply to
those chemical substances subject to standard review in accordance with the European reach Regulation. Within the context of the voluntary Global Product Strategy (gps) of the chemical industry, we also
assess the substances we use and reduce potential health and environmental risks that could result from
our chemicals. The product safety assessments apply to the entire life cycle of a product ‚Äì from research
and procurement through production and logistics to application, disposal and recycling. Our product
stewardship does not end at the company gate, but also includes suppliers, customers and partners. gps
is accessible at Covestro through the ‚ÄúProduct Safety First‚Äù internet portal, and is available worldwide
in seven languages. Through this website, we inform customers and other stakeholders about our activities and product safety assessments.
online annex: 3-8.3-1
A product safety assessment at Covestro takes place in several steps: first, chemicals that are subject to statutory regulations are identified and the corresponding laws compiled. Then we examine
their risk potential to obtain a basis for the effective minimization of risks. Such steps can include
proposals for technical measures such as protective clothing, or marketing restrictions. Finally, we
produce the legally required material safety data sheets, technical information sheets and labeling
for the chemicals. Here we go beyond the extent prescribed by law and also produce these documents for chemicals that are not subject to this statutory obligation. All product groups undergo
this process.
For especially important products such as mdi, tdi, polycarbonate and polyether, Covestro additionally
works with associations to draw up environmental product declarations and eco-balances certified according to iso 14040 and 14044 based on industry averages.
Covestro follows the scientific discussion about the chemical bisphenol a (bpa), a feedstock for various
plastics with a controversial public profile. Critics are concerned that health risks could result for users
if traces of bpa are released from polymers. As documented by numerous scientifically valid studies,
we are convinced that bpa can be safely used in its existing areas of application ‚Äì especially those that
involve contact with food. This assessment is consistent with evaluations by the authorities responsible
for food safety in Europe, the United States, Australia, Japan and other countries. In cooperation with
the PlasticsEurope association, we work to make the discussion more objective and more strongly
based on scientific analysis. Covestro actively participates in this dialogue and informs customers and
the public via the internet.

9. Safety
Safety management and the continuous development of a safety culture are a cornerstone of corporate
responsibility in the Bayer Group. Preventing accidents and incidents in day-to-day work, when operating production facilities, and on work-related travel and transportation routes where people or the environment could suffer harm or damage has top priority for us. Responsibility for health, safety, environmental protection and quality (hseq) thus lies directly with the Bayer Board of Management. Our hseq
activities are geared toward ensuring occupational health and safety, the smooth and safe operation of
our facilities, and the safe transportation of our products. In this way, we also reduce running costs by
avoiding damage and disruptions to work and production.

At the Group level, responsibilities and framework conditions for hseq are regulated through appropriate directives such as our new Bayer Group Regulation ‚ÄúSafety at the Bayer Group.‚Äù Operational responsibility lies with the boards of management / executive boards of the respective subgroups and
service companies and the corresponding line organizations, which have their own management systems, committees and working groups to steer hseq. Continuous review and revision of directives and
regular internal audits and external certification processes ensure our hseq management systems at all
sites meet the specific requirements in each case.

9.1 Occupational Health and Safety
We regard safeguarding the occupational health and safety of our employees and of contractors and
suppliers working on our company premises and under the supervision of Bayer as one of our core
tasks. This entails preventing work-related accidents and occupational illnesses, identifying and assessing potential hazards, maintaining comprehensive risk management and designing a healthy working environment.

Group target 2020:
reduction of 35% in
occupational safety
incident rate (RIR)
See also Chapter
1.4 for Group
targets

The rate of occupational injuries with lost workdays at Bayer has been falling for several years. In 2015
intensive training and awareness-raising once again helped enable the Bayer subgroups and service
companies to report an overall reduction in injury figures.
We record all injuries to Bayer employees requiring medical treatment that goes beyond simple first aid.
These are indicated by the Recordable Incident Rate (rir), which includes both injuries with lost workdays and those without. In 2015, this rate dropped to 0.42 cases per 200,000 hours worked (2014: 0.43)
throughout the Group, corresponding to 543 occupational injuries worldwide. This means that, in statistical terms, one recordable incident occurred for around every 476,000 hours worked.
The rate of recordable occupational injuries with lost workdays (ltrir, Lost Time Recordable Incident
Rate) also fell. In 2015, it stood at 0.21 (2014: 0.22).
Regrettably, two Bayer employees lost their lives in work-related accidents in 2015. One employee was
killed in a plane crash. Another employee suffered serious burns in a work-related accident at the
Chempark Leverkusen site and later died in a hospital. Investigations into the causes of the latter incident are still ongoing.

Cases of occupational illness are recorded by us in the countries in which this is legally permissible and
are also included in the ltrir parameter, irrespective of whether they are included in the occupational
diseases listed in international registers.
As in previous years, we hardly recorded any sector-typical accidents involving contact with chemicals
in 2015. The absolute number of injuries with lost workdays continued to decline. A significant proportion of our work-related accidents and injuries have behavior-linked causes. To increase the focus on
this area, the Bayer Safety Council headed up by the Chairman of the Board of Management launched
the Behavioral Safety initiative and the program was rolled out in the subgroups in 2015. The subject
was also the focus of our annual global Safety Day in 2015.
online annex: 3-9.1-2
The Behavioral Safety initiative focuses on the promotion of safety-conscious conduct among employees. Behavioral safety involves identifying and preventing unsafe working practices and reinforcing and consolidating safe working methods at all levels. This approach is by no means limited to
production but also covers areas of work such as research & development, marketing & sales and administration. The initiative is rolling out a comprehensive behavioral safety program in the subgroups. The first step of this process involved carrying out an assessment of the existing safety culture at all CropScience production sites in 2015, while the focus at HealthCare was on sites with the
biggest impact on safety performance. At Covestro, a pilot project was conducted at the site in Antwerp, Belgium. As a next step, all subgroups carried out both basic training courses for employees
and manager training courses on behavioral safety at a number of these sites. The successfully
launched program will be intensified next year.

9. Safety

We are committed to maintaining and promoting employee health and performance through targeted
shaping of the working environment. As part of our occupational health management activities, we offer
numerous preventive measures, ranging from ergonomic workplaces and stress management to incentive systems to promote healthy behavior. This also includes support for treating illnesses or reintegration measures.
As Bayer is active in countries with major differences in health care infrastructures and legal frameworks, the needs and options in health promotion vary. Bayer aims to provide employees with access to
adequate, affordable and targeted health offerings such as regular medical check-ups, sports programs,
help in overcoming illness and on-site medical care.
Our employee representatives are included in operational health management and are actively involved
in its development.
online annex: 3-9.1-3
At the Bayer European Forum ‚Äì a joint committee of representatives of management and employees
‚Äì both parties signed the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in the e.u.. According to the declaration, workplace health promotion covers all joint measures by employers, employees and society to improve health and well-being in the workplace. The objective of the network
is to identify and disseminate best practices on the basis of continuous sharing of experience. So far
around 200 European companies have signed the declaration.
Group-wide initiatives to foster employees‚Äô health and maintain their employability in view of the rise
in the retirement age include, in Germany, the General Works Agreements on lifetime working and
demographic change and on shaping demographic change for nonmanagerial employees at Bayer.
These innovative agreements contain measures to reduce the workload of shift workers from the age
of 55 and of all other nonmanagerial employees in Germany from the age of 57 and ease the return
to work of nonmanagerial employees after long-term illness, along with an extensive health screening program for all employees. In 2015, more than 97% of those who were eligible took part in the
program to reduce the workload of older employees.

9.2 Process and Plant Safety
We aim to design and operate our processes and facilities in such a way that they do not pose any inappropriate risks to employees, the environment or the community. To improve the safety of our production facilities and processes worldwide, Bayer is continually working to further develop the safety culture and the corresponding standards for identifying and evaluating the associated risks. At the same
time, we promote the skills of relevant employees on a regular basis. The corresponding Bayer Group
Regulation ‚ÄúProcess and Plant Safety‚Äù specifies globally harmonized procedures and standards.
online annex: 3-9.2-1
In a key move to maintain and raise safety awareness, the globally binding training program for all
Bayer employees who are able to influence process and plant safety in their work environment has
been further enhanced. The process and plant safety training program is firmly anchored in the subgroups‚Äô hseq management systems. Both traditional and web-based training has been established
for tradespeople and chemical technicians in the production facilities.

9. Safety

The organization and staffing levels of the Bayer Group‚Äôs central competence center for process and
plant safety, together with the Group hseq Platform for Process and Plant Safety, in Leverkusen, Germany, have been strengthened. Together with the regional competence centers in Shanghai, China, and
Kansas City, Missouri, United States, it works closely together in a professional network with plant
safety experts from production sites all over the world. To improve our risk analysis process, an additional system audit on the content and completeness of our safety reviews was conducted this year on a
trial basis. This quality improvement measure is due to be rolled out across HealthCare and CropScience next year and will be mandatory.
online annex: 3-9.2-2
Our experts work in international working groups of the European Chemical Industry Council (cefic)
and the American Petroleum Institute with the goal of developing a global reporting standard for key
performance indicators in plant safety. We also are involved in an intensive exchange of experiences
nationally and internationally in this area at an industrial level.
A globally standardized kpi for plant safety incidents, Loss of Primary Containment (LoPC), applies to all
Bayer plants and is integrated into Group-wide safety reporting. LoPC refers, for example, to chemicals
in amounts above defined thresholds leaking from their primary container, such as pipelines, pumps,
tanks or drums, and is thus an indicator of incidents in production facilities. We use the LoPC Incident
Rate (LoPC-ir) to determine the number of LoPC incidents per 200,000 working hours in areas relevant
to plant safety. In 2015, this was 0.22 (2014: 0.23).

More information on the procedures in the case of LoPC incidents can be found in
online annex: 3-9.2-3
The causes of every reported incident are carefully analyzed. The evaluations indicate areas where
there is room for further improving the safety of existing facilities. The results of the cause analysis
are published across the Group. The introduction of both the LoPC-ir parameter and the globally established training program mentioned above is helping us raise employees‚Äô safety awareness.
The reporting level is set so low that even material and energy leaks that have no impact on employees, neighbors or the environment are systematically recorded and reported. This approach is in line
with our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our facilities at all times.
The global, comprehensive Bayer Emergency Response System (BayERS) is an overarching early warning system for the Group. The subgroups and service companies have integrated their internal reporting
procedures into BayERS and adapted them to it.
online annex: 3-9.2-4
The handling of unusual incidents is the responsibility of the local crisis organization / emergency
response team. For this purpose, organizational precautions with defined responsibilities and procedures have been implemented at the sites / in the countries. Depending on the situation, these involve
business partners and the local community around the sites.

9.3 Transportation Safety
Great importance is attached to transportation safety within the Bayer safety culture. This applies to the
transportation of materials on public transportation routes, particularly in the case of hazardous materials. This includes various processes such as loading and unloading, classification, labeling, packaging
and selecting the right logistics partners.
In a dedicated Bayer Group directive, we have defined procedures that ensure all transported materials
are handled in line with applicable regulations and the potential hazard they pose. Logistics service
providers are selected following a defined procedure, and their fulfillment of safety and quality standards is assessed. Under the directive, people responsible for transportation safety are appointed in every
organizational unit concerned. As part of our Responsible Care activities, transportation safety instructions are also drawn up and distribution safety audits performed for nonhazardous materials. We thus
go beyond what is required under transportation legislation. Bayer‚Äôs objective is to achieve an appropriate and equally high standard of hseq throughout the world and to continuously improve this, particularly regarding transportation processes. The transportation safety and security management of our
subgroups is part of the audit system of the Bayer Group detailed in the Bayer Group Regulation
‚ÄúHealth, Safety, Environment and Quality (hseq) Audits,‚Äù which was updated in 2015.
The subgroups have also set up a network of transportation safety experts and users with practical
experience to share and harmonize know-how and procedures for transportation and distribution safety
and security including emergency response management and incident reporting. The Transportation
Safety Platform acts as a global forum for exchanging information and standardizing procedures between the subgroups. In 2015, the platform focused, for example, on regulations management, training
in transportation safety and use of this worldwide, the review of internal process instructions and the
evaluation and selection of our logistics service providers.
In total, well over one million transport movements took place in 2015. Despite our extensive safety
precautions and training activities, residual risks remain and can result in transport incidents. We
classify critical incidents during the transportation of our products as transport incidents. These include accidents that cause personal injury or significant damage to property and environmental impact
through the release of substances or leakage of hazardous materials. We record transport incidents
using defined criteria. Assessment is based on the spilled load, graded according to the volume and
dangerous goods class, personal injury and blocked transportation routes. We take into account both
our own chemical transport movements and those we commission and pay third parties to perform on
our behalf. We carefully analyze and evaluate all transport incidents so that adequate steps can be
taken to prevent a recurrence.

TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS
The number of transport incidents in 2015 was 12, the same as last year. These were mainly traffic
accidents.

Group target 2020:
reduction of 30% in
transport incidents

In recent years most transport incidents occurred at Covestro. For this reason, as a Life Science
company Bayer will refrain from continuing with the relevant Group target in the future. Instead, we
shall endeavor to minimize the number of such incidents through preventive measures.

The number of environmental incidents fell from four to two in 2015. Bayer uses the term ‚Äúenvironmental incidents‚Äù to define incidents in the course of our business activities that result in the release of
substances into the environment. Factors that determine whether there is a reporting obligation include,
in particular, the nature and quantity of the substance, the amount of damage caused and any consequences for nearby residents. In accordance with our internal voluntary commitment, we report any
leakage of substances with a high hazard potential from a quantity of 100 kg upward.

At the Muskegon site, a small quantity of product entered
the municipal wastewater system. The local community
complained about the odor this caused. The responsible
authorities were notified as a precaution. There were no
hazards. Due to the low quantity, the incident is not
classified as an environmental incident.

10. Environmental Protection
Bayer takes its responsibility to protect the environment very seriously. We are continuously working to
reduce the environmental impact of our business activities and find innovative product solutions that
benefit the environment. Our environmental standards apply worldwide.
An efficient approach to raw materials and energy is now both an ecological and economic imperative.
Eco-efficient processes help reduce environmental impact and at the same time cut the costs associated
with materials, energy, emissions and disposal.
Our use of energy sources, water and other resources, as well as the emissions and waste we generate,
are determined to a great extent by just a few factors. Our product portfolio and demand for our products determine the use of materials and energy. At the same time, we continuously improve our production processes to make them more resource-friendly and lower the emissions they generate. We measure how efficiently we use our resources in relation to manufactured sales volume, which does not include intermediates.
Responsibilities and framework conditions for health, safety, environmental protection and quality
(hseq) are stipulated at the Group level, with Group regulations, targets and performance indicators
(kpis), among other things, serving this purpose. In the field of environmental protection (from, for
example, resource use to air, water and soil emissions and waste generation), operational management
takes place at the subgroup level, with the aid of hseq management systems, committees and working
groups.
Our commitment to environmental protection, health and safety extends beyond the scope of legal
requirements. It includes factoring in environmental aspects in a particular way and performing a voluntary ecological assessment for capital expenditure projects exceeding ‚Ç¨10 million. In the case of acquisitions, we examine prior to the transaction whether the applicable environmental and occupational
safety regulations and fundamental employee rights are complied with at the production sites in question.

10.1 International Standards and Certifications
To maintain high hseq standards throughout the Group, Bayer has established appropriate management systems that are aligned to acknowledged international standards and are regularly evaluated
and updated. They form an integral part of all our business processes. Regular upkeep of the management systems and appropriate training and certification also demonstrate our commitment to the
chemical industry‚Äôs Responsible Care‚Ñ¢ initiative and in particular the guidelines of the Responsible
Care Global Charter.
With regard to the coverage of our business activities with hseq management systems based on energy consumption, in 2015 around 96% of our production sites featured an hse management system
audited by Bayer. Some 93% of our entire business activities were certified externally to at least one
internationally recognized standard. As part of a Group-wide certification plan, it is planned, by 2017,
to achieve virtually complete coverage based on energy consumption by external standards in both
environmental and occupational safety management. One hundred percent coverage is not feasible
owing to the frequent changes in our site portfolio.

10.2 Energy Consumption
In 2015, we succeeded in reducing the Group‚Äôs total energy consumption by 2.5% to 83.2 petajoules.
Basically, we differentiate between primary energy consumption ‚Äì mainly of fossil fuels for our own
generation of electricity and steam ‚Äì and secondary energy consumption that reflects the purchase of
electricity, steam and refrigeration energy and the use of process heat.

133

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
10. Environmental Protection

Primary energy consumption fell by 5.7%. This was mainly due to the reduction in natural gas, which
was primarily achieved through more efficient facility operation at the Uerdingen site in Germany. The
use of coal was approximately at the same level as the previous year, while consumption of liquid fuels
and other primary energy sources was reduced. Waste utilization was significantly higher than the
previous year, mainly owing to the use of liquid waste as a source of energy at Covestro‚Äôs site in
Caojing, China. Secondary energy consumption rose by 1.1%. The use of electricity declined, while
consumption of steam and process heat was higher than in 2014 (see Table 3.10.2).
The drop in total energy consumption (primary and secondary energy sources) was mainly caused by
lower energy needs at the Leverkusen and Uerdingen sites in Germany. Moreover, the partial shutdown
of production facilities at the Belford Roxo site in Brazil also contributed to a reduction in total energy
consumption.
In 2015, Bayer‚Äôs manufactured sales volume rose by 2.7%. We were able to slightly improve our
energy efficiency, which we define as the total energy consumption in megawatt hours (MWh) per
metric ton of manufactured sales volume, from 3.37 MWh/t in 2014 to 3.34 MWh/t in 2015. This
development confirms the trend of a decoupling of manufactured sales volume from energy consumption identified in previous years. This brings us closer to our Group target of improving energy
efficiency by 10% by 2020.

More than 90% of our own energy generation comes from combined heat and power processes.
These efficient power plants convert approximately 80% of the fuel energy used into electricity and
heat. In addition, we purchase electricity on the market ‚Äì through energy exchanges, for example. The
electricity and heat generated and purchased are used in our own production facilities and third-party
facilities (especially of Lanxess Deutschland GmbH as the other shareholder of our service company
Currenta). The proportion of renewable energies is determined by the energy mix of our energy suppliers. We comment in detail on these issues in our cdp (previously Carbon Disclosure Project) Report.

10.3 Air Emissions
At Bayer, air emissions are caused mainly by the generation and consumption of electricity, steam and
process heat. Our commitment to greater energy efficiency helps reduce both costs and emissions. We
also aim to contribute to climate protection on several levels. We have set ambitious targets for resource
efficiency and established relevant measures across the Group.
Our commitment is divided into three areas:
Group target
Covestro:
improvement in
production process
technology to
achieve better
energy efficiency

www.bayer.com/
COV-production

1. More efficient production: we aim to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in our own production facilities by increasing energy efficiency, using combined heat and power generation in our power
plants and developing and marketing new, more climate-friendly technologies. Thanks to our own energy management systems and production and process innovations, considerable resources have been
saved in recent years. Energy efficiency projects resulting from structese‚Ñ¢ (Structured Efficiency
System for Energy) implemented since 2008 lead to annual savings. Taking into account all sustainable
savings effects since the system was introduced, these savings amounted to 1.55 million MWh in the
area of primary energy consumption in 2015.

See also Chapter 4

2. Reducing emissions using market solutions: our products play their part in saving energy and conserving resources in many different ways. We are able to help our customers in the areas of building
insulation, lightweight construction and agriculture in particular. We provide solutions both for reducing
emissions and for adapting to climate change. These include state-of-the-art crop protection products
that enable higher yields, new cultivation methods such as precision farming and the development of
crops that are better able to cope with stress factors such as extreme temperatures and aridity. You can
read more, for example, about combating the growing threat of malaria ‚Äì resulting from climate change
‚Äì in the CropScience section of Chapter 4 ‚ÄúResearch, Development, Innovation.‚Äù
3. Reducing emissions in nonproduction areas of Bayer: this includes ‚Äì with the planned reduction of
specific co2 emissions of newly registered vehicles to 110 g/km through 2020 ‚Äì an ambitious reduction
target for our vehicle fleet, optimized logistics and enhancement of the environmentally friendly credentials of our information and communication technologies (Green it). Through our EcoFleet initiative, co2
emissions of newly registered vehicles for our global fleet of over 25,000 vehicles were reduced by a
further 7 g/km to 141 g/km in 2015.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Bayer reports all Group greenhouse gas emissions in line with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol (ghg Protocol). Direct emissions from our own power plants, waste incineration plants and
production facilities (corresponding to Scope 1 of the ghg Protocol) and indirect emissions that result
from the external procurement of electricity, steam and refrigeration energy (Scope 2) are determined at
all production locations and relevant administrative sites.
Dual reporting was introduced in 2015 with the updating of the ghg guidelines for Scope 2. According
to this, indirect emissions have to be reported using both the location-based and the market-based
methods. The location-based method uses regional or national average emissions factors, while the
market-based method uses provider- or product-specific emissions factors. From 2015, we are reporting
for the first time in line with the new guideline, shown retroactively to 2012. To ensure the comparability of the data we are additionally reporting according to the previous system once more this year.

methane.
3 Typically, CO in incineration processes accounts for over 99% of all greenhouse gas emissions. When determining indirect emissions, our
2
calculations are therefore limited to CO2.
4 Back calculation using the market-based method is only possible from 2012, as the RE-DISS factors needed for the calculation were only available
for the first time for that year.
5 The market-based method of the new Scope 2 GHG Protocol most reliably reflects the indirect emissions and the success of emissions reduction
measures, so we used emissions volumes calculated using this method when calculating the total and specific greenhouse gas emissions.
6 Specific Group emissions are calculated from the total volume of direct emissions and indirect ‚Äì calculated using the market-based method of the
new Scope 2 GHG Protocol ‚Äì emissions of the subgroups, including the emissions at the Belford Roxo site and emissions from the vehicle fleet,
both reported for the Group as a whole, divided by the manufactured sales volume of the three subgroups in metric tons. Quantities attributable to
the supply of energy to external companies are deducted from the direct and indirect emissions. At Covestro, neither the by-products sodium
hydroxide solution and hydrochloric acid generated during production nor trade products are included in the manufactured sales volume.

10. Environmental Protection

The total volume of Group-wide greenhouse gas emissions rose by 1.7% (Scope 2 market-based) in
2015. Broken down, direct emissions rose by 9.7%, while indirect emissions fell by 4.1% (Scope 2
market-based). The rise in direct emissions is largely due to higher nitrous oxide emissions caused by a
significant increase in nitric acid production at the site in Caojing, China, and to additional emissions
from the incineration of liquid and thermal waste there. Another reason was increased energy consumption by third parties at the CropScience site in Institute, United States.
Group target 2020:
reduction of 20% in
specific greenhouse
gas emissions

In line with our Group target we are endeavoring to reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions (total
emissions divided by the manufactured sales volume) by 20% through 2020. 2015 saw a rise of 6.0%
(Scope 2 being calculated according to the market-based method) owing mainly to the effects described
above.

1.4 for Group

online annex: 3-10.3-1
Even though a significant proportion of our direct emissions comes from the generation of energy
that is delivered to other companies, we include all greenhouse gas emissions from the conversion of
primary energy sources into electricity, steam or refrigeration energy in our energy balance, in line
with the regulations of the ghg Protocol. Consequently, our absolute figures for greenhouse gas
emissions are higher than the actual emissions resulting from Bayer‚Äôs business activities. The level of
specific greenhouse gas emissions is a more meaningful statistic. This indicates only the greenhouse
gas emissions for which Bayer is directly responsible in relation to the manufactured sales volumes
of the three Bayer subgroups.

The indirect emissions were calculated according to the market-based method. Since the RE-DISS factors needed for this were only available
from 2012 on, the data are only indicated for the past 4 years.
2 Emissions from the Bayer Group‚Äôs vehicle fleet have been recorded since 2012, but not specific to any subgroup, and are assigned to the
direct Group emissions in Table 3.10.3. In 2015, fleet emissions amounted to 0.14 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents.
3 The emissions reported for Currenta are attributable to the provision of energy to external companies at the Chempark sites.
4 The by-products sodium hydroxide solution and hydrochloric acid generated during production are not included in the manufactured sales
volume, nor are trade products.
5 The emissions from the production site in Belford Roxo, Brazil, totaling 0.06 million metric tons of CO equivalents, are not included in this
2
table but are reported for the Group as a whole in Table 3.10.3.

In 2015, the waste incineration plants operated by Currenta generated just under 1 million metric
tons of steam from the incineration of more than 250,000 metric tons of hazardous waste from the
Chempark sites and some external production companies. Compared to using fossil energy sources,
the use of this steam enables approximately 200,000 metric tons less co2 to be emitted per year.
The reporting of all relevant indirect emissions resulting from the value chain is bindingly regulated by
the ghg Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Reporting Standard. Following a thorough examination, Bayer has identified nine essential Scope 3 categories, which we report on in detail
in the cdp Report. We take particular account of those emissions where there is significant potential for
reduction e.g. our transport-related emissions resulting from business trips.

137

Bayer Annual Report 2015

10. Environmental Protection

In 2015, the Bayer Group was involved in European emissions trading with 19 plants in total. The
greenhouse gas emissions of these plants amounted to approximately 2.32 million metric tons of co2
equivalents.
OTHER DIRECT EMISSIONS INTO THE AIR
Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ods) fell by 20.7%. Emissions of volatile organic compounds
excluding methane (vocs) decreased by 24.0%. The main source of both types of emissions remains the
CropScience site in Vapi, India, which accounts for 55.4% of voc emissions and 94.3% of ods emissions. The project initiated there four years ago to reduce these emissions continues to have an impact.
voc emissions fell by a further 38.3%. ods emissions there also decreased, by 21.1%. A central waste
air treatment system will go into operation at the Vapi site during 2016. This will bring together the
many different sources of emissions there and cause another significant reduction in these emissions.

increases could essentially be attributed to differences in the types of coal used at the Uerdingen site
in Germany.

10.4 Use of Water and Emissions into Water
The continuous availability of clean water in sufficient quantities is essential for supplying our production sites and the surrounding areas. However, this can no longer be taken for granted in many parts of
the world. We plan to design our water supply in such a way that industrial water usage continues not
to lead to local problems such as a shortage of water for the people living in the area.
Our Water Position commits us to compliance with international and local legislation and to fulfilling the
strictest requirements worldwide while at the same time ensuring the reliable operation of our production facilities. The goal is to protect water as a resource and use it efficiently.
In their respective directives, our subgroups have defined responsible water use, ranging from resource-friendly usage to appropriate disposal of wastewater, and anchored implementation in their hseq
management systems.
Group target 2017:
establishment of water
management at all
sites in water-scarce
areas

See also Chapter
1.4 for Group
targets

As part of our Water Position, we used the wbcsd Global Water Tool‚Ñ¢ to identify all Bayer sites that are
located in regions affected or threatened by water shortage. In line with our Group target, these sites
are to establish a water management system with local targets by 2017. The sites concerned are analyzed annually, including an evaluation of their water usage, quality and discharge data. In addition,
site-specific initiatives that enable the reuse of water and thus contribute to reducing water consumption are also examined and evaluated. Results of the current analysis show that an effective water management system is already in place at around 58% of the sites examined.
Although the framework conditions for sites can differ very considerably according to region, some
measures successfully implemented at several sites have already been seen to be effective. These include both in-house water treatment plants to make river water usable and river water reservoirs to
avoid having to take drinking water from local water suppliers even when water levels are low. Further
effective steps for pursuing the water target include continuous analysis of wastewater in line with sitespecific performance indicators and training new employees in responsible water usage.
Awareness of this issue is being raised through ongoing Group-wide dialogue. Equally important in this
is active participation in forums and discussions on this subject with government officials and other
stakeholders. The next step will be to agree specific measures for the targeted development at those
sites with identified potential for improvement.

CDP-water

Bayer supports the ceo Water Mandate of the u.n. Global Compact with the goal of working with key
stakeholders to develop sustainable strategies for water usage. In our annual response to the cdp Water
Disclosure, we report in detail on our water usage, the company-specific water footprint and the associated opportunities and risks. This represents a progress report for the ceo Water Mandate.
WATER CONSUMPTION AND USAGE
In 2015, total water consumption in the Group fell by 1.1% to around 346 million cubic meters.
Some 73% of all water used by Bayer is cooling water. This water is only heated and does not come
into contact with products. It can be returned to the water cycle without further treatment in line with
the relevant official permits. The total volume of once-through cooling water was around 240 million
cubic meters in 2015. In our production activities, we endeavor to use water several times and to recycle it. Water is currently recycled at 35 sites, e.g. in closed cooling cycles, or through the reuse of treated wastewater or the recirculation of steam condensates as process water. A total of 10.5 million cubic
meters of water were reused in 2015.

WASTEWATER AND WASTEWATER DISCHARGES
The total volume of process wastewater fell by 7.7%. All wastewater is subject to strict monitoring and
analysis before it is discharged into disposal channels. 81.9% of Bayer‚Äôs process wastewater worldwide is purified at wastewater treatment plants (Bayer or third-party facilities). Following careful analysis, the remaining volume was categorized as environmentally safe according to official provisions.
Part of it contained nutrients and was therefore used to water gardens and agricultural land, as in the
previous year.

The goal is to minimize emissions into wastewater. Total emissions of nitrogen compounds into
wastewater fell by 26.1% in 2015. The main factors behind this reduction were the decrease in production at CropScience‚Äôs Dormagen site in Germany and the fact that the denitrification process at
Covestro‚Äôs Baytown site in Texas in the United States operated without interruption again in 2015.
Discharges of phosphates into wastewater rose by 2.0% in 2015. Total organic carbon (toc) emissions,
however, decreased by 3.3%.

10.5 Waste and Recycling
Systematic waste management minimizes material consumption and disposal volumes. Safe disposal
channels with separation according to the type of waste and economically expedient recycling processes serve this purpose. Production fluctuations and building refurbishment / land remediation work also
influence waste volumes and recycling paths.
In 2015, the total volume of waste generated rose by 4.9%. Although the volume of nonhazardous waste
fell by 2.5%, the volume of hazardous waste generated rose by 11.1%. This contrast is largely due to
the re-categorization of fluidized bed ash from the power plant at the Chempark Leverkusen site, which
now has to be classified as hazardous waste. Increased production at the sites in Wuppertal, Germany,
and Muttenz, Switzerland, also led to greater volumes of hazardous waste.

Bayer serves as a certified waste disposal plant operator at various sites. At these locations, Bayer disposes not only of its own waste but also
of waste from third parties (companies not belonging to the Bayer Group). For that reason, the volume of waste disposed of differs slightly
from the volume of waste generated by Bayer.
2 E.g. passed on to third parties (providers / waste disposal companies)

In 2015, the volume of recycled waste was 295,826 metric tons. Expressed as a proportion of the total waste disposed of, this represented an increase from 29% in 2014 to 31% in 2015. Site-specific
reasons such as changes to the product portfolio, other production volumes, variations in the intensity of construction measures and recycling projects were key to this.

RECYCLING
In addition to satisfying economic and environmental criteria, the recycling and treatment of our materials also has to comply with legal requirements. This results in restrictions, in particular in the areas of
pharmaceuticals and crop protection. Throughout the Group, we are developing opportunities for recycling within the framework of legal regulations. Examples of recycling measures provide proof of
Bayer‚Äôs commitment to recycling.
online annex: 3-10.5-2
Production-related recycling at HealthCare is conducted in line with the requirements of the relevant
production site. When determining the best means of disposal, recycling options are explicitly included, and are to be considered preferable to landfilling or incineration.
Material-based recycling is important in CropScience‚Äôs active ingredient and intermediate product
production. For reasons of resource efficiency, solvents, catalysts and intermediates are repeatedly
processed and returned to the production process. Since these are recycling steps that are closely
linked with the process, there is no global regulation. Material-based recycling is regulated separately at each production site and production plant. In the global process development of active ingredients and intermediates, material recycling is considered an important development criterion. In accordance with CropScience‚Äôs global Environment Policy, all CropScience sites are obliged to prevent,
recycle and reduce waste and dispose of it safely and in line with good environmental practices.

142

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
10. Environmental Protection

The subgroups select the best means of disposal for any given waste type at the production site
based on the applicable national or local legal requirements, the technical possibilities available on
site, environmental protection aspects and the internal hierarchy of waste disposal.
No product-related recycling is possible for the HealthCare portfolio because pharmaceutical products are subject to strict quality requirements. Packaging materials are recycled in line with national
regulations as part of the national infrastructure for waste disposal.
CropScience does not generally take back crop protection products it has sold. Packaging materials
are disposed of or recycled in line with national legislation. In many countries where there is no legal
regulation, the industry has set up a returns system in collaboration with other providers.
Returns of obsolete stocks of crop protection products are only conducted in individual cases where
there is good reason. However, the crop protection product industry has set up voluntary initiatives
in various countries that enable farmers to ensure obsolete stocks are disposed of safely. As part of
its activities in the CropLife association, CropScience is working with the United Nations‚Äô Food and
Agriculture Organization (fao) and the World Bank to support the proper collection and disposal of
obsolete stocks in Africa.
In its own production operations, Covestro also uses material recycled from plastic waste. These
kinds of high-quality secondary raw materials are used to manufacture certain grades of engineering
thermoplastics. A flame-retardant plastic compound for television set housings, for example, comprises 30% recycled pet water bottles.
The Global Sideline Business unit at Covestro sells unwanted plant and tools on the open market,
thus feeding them back into circulation. Approximately 150 tangible assets were sold to third parties
worldwide in 2015. Scrap metal from plants is returned to the material cycle. In 2015, this amounted
to around 1,600 metric tons in Germany alone.
Covestro is actively committed to recycling through its involvement in associations such as
PlasticsEurope and to the avoidance of plastic granule wastage in industrial plants through the Zero
Pellet Loss initiative. The company is also a shareholder of bkv GmbH, German industry‚Äôs competence platform for recycling plastic.
Using conventional recycling measures, Currenta was able to return approximately 45,000 metric
tons of building materials, fgd gypsum and slag, 14,300 metric tons of metal and 15,800 metric tons
of chemicals such as sulfuric acid and solvents to the material cycle in 2015.

10.6 Biodiversity
Our Group-wide biodiversity position takes into account influences on biodiversity throughout the entire
value chain. In this position, we commit ourselves to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol, which regulates access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable
sharing of the benefits arising from their utilization. Our CropScience subgroup passed an internal
regulation in 2015 to ensure that the company only acquires and uses genetic resources in harmony
with international and applicable national legislation.

Biodiversity is essential for successful agriculture, as it promotes the resilience of ecosystems. Various ecological enhancement measures are under discussion to support resilient ecosystems, such as
planting flower strips to provide a refuge for animals or the more extensive cultivation of slopes to
protect against erosion. These measures can help farmers improve soil fertility and water regulation
in their fields, or boost the pollination activities of insects and thus increase their yields.
HealthCare also attaches great importance to maintaining biological diversity. As a member of the
Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies, it supports the association‚Äôs position on
the u.n. Convention on Biological Diversity. Among other things, this policy, which applies to all
HealthCare sites, takes into account that the subgroup concentrates on the chemical synthesis of
substances using state-of-the-art technologies in medicinal, combinatorial and computational chemistry. Research into natural substances is not a focal point of its work, accounting for less than 5% of
research projects. If such substances are used during research into new pharmaceuticals, they are
first checked with respect to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Group-wide directives stipulate that new production sites must not be set up in areas that are protected
by statutory requirements of the countries concerned relating to natural characteristics, biodiversity or
other factors.
online annex: 3-10.6-2
In 2013, Bayer Real Estate, the Bayer Group‚Äôs real estate service provider, used its global site register to compare the geographical coordinates of relevant production sites against those of internationally recognized protected areas (asean Heritage, Barcelona Convention, unesco-mab Biosphere Reserve, Wetlands and World Heritage Convention and Ramsar Convention). This comparison revealed
three sites that are less than three kilometers from the protected areas Schorren van de Benenden
Schelde, Belgium; the Wadden Sea of Lower Saxony, Germany; and Blesbokspruit, South Africa,
respectively. Owing to major portfolio changes in the Group (separation of Covestro, formerly
MaterialScience, sale of the Diabetes Care business and acquisition of the consumer care business of
Merck & Co., Inc.) we are planning a new coordinate comparison with an updated range of production sites in 2016.

11. Social Commitment
Bayer‚Äôs funding strategy focuses on people embarking on new approaches to problem-solving in the
natural and life sciences and in the key areas of health, education and basic social needs, with the goal
of sustainably improving living conditions. This also applies to a further focus area, sports and culture.
With our support programs we see ourselves as investors, trendsetters and partners for initiatives and
projects that have model character, a long-term effect and thus the potential to achieve systemic
change.

11. Social Commitment

The Foundation & Donations Management Department within the Corporate Office of Bayer AG is responsible for strategically aligning and coordinating our social commitment, as well as for monitoring
and reporting activities. The Group-wide donation allocation and management regulations form the
basis for this. The country companies, in collaboration with partner organizations such as nongovernmental organizations, bear responsibility for implementing a large number of the initiatives. An independent panel made up of internal and external judges generally decides how project funding is allocated.
In 2015, we invested a total of ‚Ç¨51 million (2014: ‚Ç¨49 million) in charitable activities worldwide. This
was aimed at improving the quality of life at the company‚Äôs various locations and contributing to solving
social challenges.

HEALTH AND BASIC SOCIAL NEEDS
In 2015, the Bayer Cares Foundation awarded the Aspirin Social Award to the Jourvie charitable initiative. The first-place prize money of ‚Ç¨15,000 will enable the already successful app for supporting
the treatment of eating disorders to be further developed and disseminated. The foundation entered
into a collaboration with the ‚ÄúDiscovering Hands‚Äù initiative, which was a prize-winner in 2014. This
will introduce this exemplary social medicine project, which is already established in Germany, to
other countries. Blind women, trained as Medical Tactile Examiners, use their extraordinary sense of
touch to help with the early diagnosis of breast cancer in women. Colombia is the first pilot country
outside Germany. The Latin American Development Bank is another project partner.
Since the Bayer Volunteering Program began in Germany in 2007 and worldwide in 2013, the Bayer
Cares Foundation has provided support for 550 volunteering projects in 65 countries. Through these
projects, employees and citizens work toward improving living conditions in and around the company‚Äôs sites. In 2015, the foundation brought 100 projects in 38 countries into the program, due primarily to their innovative approaches, providing them with a total of around ‚Ç¨304,000 in funding.

Bayer is involved in an initiative aimed at eliminating or stemming the incidence of 10 neglected
tropical diseases, which threaten the lives of 1.4 billion people, by 2020. We provide medication to
tackle these diseases and participate in collaborations for developing new medicines. The World
Health Organization (who), governments, nongovernmental organizations and other companies are
partners in this global initiative. Focal points that fit in with Bayer‚Äôs product portfolio are Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness, dengue and river blindness.
For more than 10 years, we have donated our active ingredients for the treatment of African sleeping
sickness and Chagas disease, which is widespread in Latin America, to the who free of charge. In
2015, we again supplied one million Lampit‚Ñ¢ tablets (active ingredient: nifurtimox 120 mg) to treat
Chagas disease, as well as providing us$300,000 for logistics and distribution. We are also currently
developing a nifurtimox tablet with a lower dosage that will make it easier to treat children with
Chagas disease.
We are pleased to report that the number of patients affected by the type of African sleeping sickness
primarily found in eastern and southern Africa is in steady decline. We were therefore able to reduce
the amount of Germanin‚Ñ¢ supplied to the who to 10,000 ampoules worth ‚Ç¨114,000 in 2015. We
again provided 300,000 tablets of the active ingredient nifurtimox to be used in a combination therapy with an active ingredient from another manufacturer to treat the most widespread, West African
version of sleeping sickness. We also came to an agreement with the who to further expand support
for patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the country most severely affected by
sleeping sickness.
In a new product development partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, we are
examining whether the active ingredient emodepside, which is currently used in veterinary medicine, could also be used to treat river blindness in humans and thus achieve a significant shortening
of treatment time.
In 2015, Bayer was once again active in supporting people experiencing acute hardship as a result of
natural disasters. For example, we donated medication and money with a total value of ‚Ç¨400,000 for
people affected by the earthquake in Nepal. We contributed money and water purification tablets
with a total value of ‚Ç¨25,000 to help victims of the floods in Myanmar.
We donated antibiotics with the total value of just under ‚Ç¨1.9 million to the aid organization Health
Partners International of Canada (hpic) for the treatment of people in crisis areas and humanitarian
emergencies.
We also made drugs with a market value of just under ‚Ç¨1.5 million available free of charge to aid organizations and authorities in Turkey, Greece and Austria to treat refugees.
EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
The Bayer Science & Education Foundation again awarded prizes in 2015 with the primary goal of
recognizing and raising the profile of pioneering work in life sciences and basic medical research.
Winner of the Hansen Family Award 2015 is the French infection researcher Professor Emmanuelle
Charpentier from the Helmholtz Center in Braunschweig, Germany. She is responsible for key insights in the field of genome editing. In 2015, the Bayer Early Excellence in Science Award and the
Bayer Thrombosis Research Award ‚Äì the two prizes that promote young scientists ‚Äì went to young
researchers from Germany and the United States for their successes in the fields of medicine, biology and chemistry, and specifically in thrombosis research.

The company awarded 187 scholarships to talented students, postgraduates and trainees in the fields
of natural, life and agricultural science and medicine, with the particular goal of enabling projects
abroad. With regard to our support of schools, the ‚ÄúMaking Science Make Sense‚Äù initiative in the
United States celebrated its 20th anniversary. This program involves several hundred employees volunteering regularly to visit elementary schools and use everyday experiments to communicate the
fascination and practical importance of science. Bayer implemented similar programs also aimed at
young people in more than 20 countries in 2015.
GRI
G4-26

To this end, our country companies cooperated with museums, universities and other educational institutions, invited schoolchildren to the company‚Äôs own student laboratories or took ‚Äúresearch
trucks‚Äù to the schools.
In Germany, the focus was on funding innovative teaching projects with a total of ‚Ç¨500,000 for 63
specific measures at 57 schools and other educational institutions in 31 towns and cities, plus the
awarding of travel scholarships and support of competitions for school students. In addition, the
Humboldt Bayer Mobil, a research laboratory on wheels, regularly visited schools and the four
Baylab student laboratories offered school classes a professional infrastructure. More than 20,000
schoolchildren used these facilities alone in 2015.
Given the huge influx of refugees into Germany, the Bayer Science & Education Foundation has expanded its range of scientific school education programs to also target refugee children. Along with
the Berlin Senate and other educational organizations, the foundation launched a unique pilot project
‚Äì the Science4Life Academy.
For the first time, teaching materials specifically for children with no knowledge of German are being
developed and introduced into science lessons, and teachers are receiving targeted training. Our
company also offers talented schoolchildren the chance of individualized support in the form of internships and mentoring. Our other activities to support refugees include a course preparing refugees aged between 18 and 26 for work, involving language training and careers advice.
SPORTS AND CULTURE
In 2015, Bayer further expanded its range of cultural activities. We continued to focus particularly on
encouraging young talent, and brought new artists into the stART program. Another key point was to
enable young people to have greater access to theater. Bayer Arts & Culture also intensified dialogue
with the public. In total, Bayer staged around 120 events in the fields of music, dance, theater and
the fine arts in 2015.
The ‚ÄúVersionale‚Äù competition for theater direction, for example, challenged creative theatrical and
cultural minds for the first time to develop short stage works on the topic of ‚ÄúScience For A Better
Life.‚Äù
The Bayer clubs again made a key contribution to the broad range of sporting activities near the
German sites in North Rhine-Westphalia. The major clubs also became more intensely involved as
professional service providers for the company‚Äôs occupational health management. In 2015, the
company provided funding of some ‚Ç¨14 million for recreational, disabled and competitive sports activities.
Bayer‚Äôs involvement in professional soccer at Bayer 04 Leverkusen GmbH is not part of its social
sports sponsorship activities because it belongs to the company‚Äôs image advertising.

FULL YEAR 2015
Bayer had a very successful year in 2015, both strategically and operationally. We achieved important
milestones on the path to becoming a Life Science company: In October 2015, we floated our subsidiary
Covestro (formerly MaterialScience) ‚Äì in which we currently hold around 69% ‚Äì on the stock exchange.
With the new organizational structure and the realignment of the Board of Management, which took
effect on January 1, 2016, we set the course for the company‚Äôs further development. We also successfully continued integrating the recently acquired consumer care businesses in our Consumer Health segment and continued to invest heavily in our research and development pipeline.
Our operating performance marked another new record in 2015. We registered higher sales and substantial earnings growth of around 18%, supported also by positive currency effects. HealthCare
showed a convincing performance, with strong sales and earnings growth. This was chiefly attributable
to the very good development of our recently launched pharmaceutical products and to expanded business in all Consumer Health divisions. In particular, the products added through the recent acquisitions
contributed additionally to growth at Consumer Care. Despite a weaker market environment, sales at
CropScience were up against the prior year. Earnings also rose. Covestro significantly raised earnings,
due mainly to lower raw material costs, while sales receded as expected. Core earnings per share of the
Bayer Group advanced by 16%.

2014 figures restated

ebit of the Bayer Group increased by 15.8% to ‚Ç¨6,250 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,395 million) after net special
charges of ‚Ç¨819 million (2014: ‚Ç¨438 million). The special charges mainly included ‚Ç¨280 million in expenses for the consolidation of production sites, ‚Ç¨227 million in integration costs for acquired businesses and ‚Ç¨212 million in expenses connected with the carve-out and stock market flotation of Covestro.
Further charges included ‚Ç¨202 million in costs for efficiency improvements, ‚Ç¨91 million for the revaluation of other receivables, and impairment losses of approximately ‚Ç¨40 million in connection with a development project. These amounts were partly offset in ebit by a special gain of around ‚Ç¨300 million
from a litigation in connection with a breach of contract and patent infringement by Dow AgroSciences
(DAS). ebit before special items rose by 21.2% to ‚Ç¨7,069 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,833 million).
ebitda before special items increased by 18.2% to ‚Ç¨10,266 million (2014: ‚Ç¨8,685 million). The good
sales development was accompanied by higher r&d expenses (up by around ‚Ç¨740 million on the prior
year). Positive currency effects buoyed earnings by about ‚Ç¨680 million. ebitda before special items at
HealthCare improved by 19.8% to ‚Ç¨6,419 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,357 million). This increase was chiefly
attributable to the very good development of business at Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health ‚Äì
including particularly the contribution from the acquired businesses at Consumer Care ‚Äì and currency
effects of around ‚Ç¨250 million. ebitda before special items of CropScience rose by 2.4% to
‚Ç¨2,416 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,360 million), mainly because of higher volumes and a positive currency effect
of about ‚Ç¨220 million. ebitda before special items of Covestro rose by a substantial 39.8% to
‚Ç¨1,659 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,187 million), primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs and positive currency effects of ‚Ç¨240 million.

12. Overview of Sales, Earnings and Financial Position

Gross cash flow from continuing operations climbed by 4.4% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨6,999 million (2014:
‚Ç¨6,707 million), mainly because of the improvement in ebitda. Net cash flow (total) rose by 18.6% to
‚Ç¨6,890 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,810 million) due to a substantial decrease in additional cash tied up in working
capital. In 2015, we paid income taxes amounting to ‚Ç¨1,699 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,835 million). We reduced
net financial debt by ‚Ç¨2.2 billion against December 31, 2014, to ‚Ç¨17.4 billion. The net defined benefit
liability for post-employment benefits ‚Äì the difference between benefit obligations and plan assets ‚Äì
decreased from ‚Ç¨12.2 billion to ‚Ç¨10.8 billion over the same period, mainly due to a rise in long-term
capital market interest rates for high-quality corporate bonds.
Total assets as of December 31, 2015, increased by 5.2% to ‚Ç¨73.9 billion. Noncurrent assets rose by
4.4% to ‚Ç¨50.1 billion due mainly to currency effects. The carrying amount of current assets climbed to
‚Ç¨23.8 billion, mainly driven by higher trade accounts receivable. Equity increased by ‚Ç¨5.2 billion to
‚Ç¨25.4 billion. This was primarily attributable to the net income of ‚Ç¨4.1 billion, the ‚Ç¨1.5 billion capital
increase at Covestro due to the stock market flotation, the ‚Ç¨0.8 billion decline ‚Äì recognized outside
profit or loss ‚Äì in post-employment benefit obligations and the exchange differences of ‚Ç¨0.7 billion. The
dividend payment of ‚Ç¨1.9 billion had an opposing effect. Liabilities decreased by ‚Ç¨1.5 billion compared
with December 31, 2014, to ‚Ç¨48.5 billion.

CropScience sales rose by 5.3% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨2,439 million (reported: + 11.1%) due mainly to
increases at Crop Protection / Seeds. Sales of Covestro fell by 10.6% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to
‚Ç¨2,774 million (reported: ‚Äì 5.9%), primarily because of much lower selling prices. On the other hand,
volumes increased slightly.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
12. Overview of Sales, Earnings and Financial Position

ebit of the Bayer Group improved by a significant 65.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to ‚Ç¨908 million
(q4 2014: ‚Ç¨549 million), reflecting special charges of ‚Ç¨116 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨442 million). The special
charges mainly included ‚Ç¨138 million in expenses for the consolidation of production sites, ‚Ç¨114 million
for efficiency improvement measures, ‚Ç¨50 million in integration costs for acquired businesses and
‚Ç¨49 million in expenses in connection with the carve-out and stock market flotation of Covestro. Further
charges of approximately ‚Ç¨40 million related to the impairment of a research project. These amounts
were partly offset by a gain of around ‚Ç¨300 million from a litigation. ebit before special items increased
by 3.3% to ‚Ç¨1,024 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨991 million).
ebitda before special items improved in the fourth quarter of 2015 by 4.0% to ‚Ç¨1,903 million (q4 2014:
‚Ç¨1,829 million). This good business development, especially at HealthCare, was accompanied by higher
r&d and selling expenses. Positive currency effects contributed ‚Ç¨200 million to earnings. HealthCare
registered a 7.2% improvement in ebitda before special items to ‚Ç¨1,511 million (q4 2014:
‚Ç¨1,409 million). At CropScience, ebitda before special items fell by 9.5% to ‚Ç¨334 million (q4 2014:
‚Ç¨369 million). Earnings of Covestro climbed by a substantial 18.4% to ‚Ç¨257 million (q4 2014:
‚Ç¨217 million).
After a financial result of minus ‚Ç¨164 million (q4 2014: minus ‚Ç¨347 million), income before income
taxes was ‚Ç¨744 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨202 million). The financial result mainly comprised interest cost of
‚Ç¨67 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨111 million) for pension and other provisions, exchange losses of ‚Ç¨67 million
(q4 2014: ‚Ç¨66 million) and net interest expense of ‚Ç¨46 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨148 million). The decline in
net interest expense resulted primarily from interest income of ‚Ç¨109 million related to a legal claim.
After income tax expense of ‚Ç¨163 million, income from discontinued operations after taxes and noncontrolling interest, net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 came to ‚Ç¨613 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨224 million).
Earnings per share improved to ‚Ç¨0.74 (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨0.27). Core earnings per share from continuing operations fell to ‚Ç¨1.07 (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨1.17). Tax income was recorded in the previous year.
See Chapter 14.3
for an explanation
of the calculation

Gross cash flow from continuing operations of the Bayer Group receded by 10.9% to ‚Ç¨1,388 million
(q4 2014: ‚Ç¨1,558 million). Net cash flow (total) moved back by 15.8% to ‚Ç¨1,877 million (q4 2014:
‚Ç¨2,230 million). The decline was mainly due to the deferred one-time payment of ‚Ç¨793 million in the
previous year in connection with the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., United States. In the
fourth quarter of 2015 we paid income taxes amounting to ‚Ç¨482 million (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨415 million). Net
financial debt fell by ‚Ç¨1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 to ‚Ç¨17.4 billion (September 30, 2015:
‚Ç¨19.3 billion), largely as a result of cash inflows from operating activities and the stock market flotation
of Covestro. The net defined benefit liability for post-employment benefits decreased by ‚Ç¨0.8 billion
against September 30, 2015, to ‚Ç¨10.8 billion, mainly due to a rise in long-term capital market interest
rates for high-quality corporate bonds.

13. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Sales of the HealthCare subgroup rose by 8.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) in 2015, to ‚Ç¨22,874 million (reported: + 19.9%). This encouraging growth was driven by our recently launched pharmaceutical products. Business expanded in all divisions of the Consumer Health segment. The considerable reported
sales increase was chiefly attributable to business with products acquired from Merck & Co., Inc., United
States, and to currency effects.

ebit of HealthCare advanced by 16.7% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨4,050 million. This figure reflected special
charges of ‚Ç¨600 million (2014: ‚Ç¨331 million). ebit before special items improved by a clear 22.3% to
‚Ç¨4,650 million. We raised ebitda before special items by a substantial 19.8% to ‚Ç¨6,419 million. This
earnings growth resulted mainly from the very favorable development of business at Pharmaceuticals
and Consumer Health ‚Äì at Consumer Health especially due to the contributions from the acquired businesses ‚Äì and from positive currency effects of about ‚Ç¨250 million. Earnings were diminished by increased investment in research and development at Pharmaceuticals and higher selling expenses at
Consumer Health.

Sales of the Pharmaceuticals segment climbed by a substantial 9.9% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to
‚Ç¨13,745 million. This very good performance was driven by our recently launched products Xarelto‚Ñ¢,
Eylea‚Ñ¢, Stivarga‚Ñ¢, Xofigo‚Ñ¢ and Adempas‚Ñ¢, which posted combined sales of ‚Ç¨4,231 million (2014:
‚Ç¨2,908 million). Our Pharmaceuticals business registered encouraging growth in all regions on a currency-adjusted basis. Business developed especially well in Germany, Japan and the United States.

Sales of our oral anticoagulant Xarelto‚Ñ¢ were up substantially in 2015, mainly as a result of expanded
volumes in Germany and Japan. We registered a strong sales gain in the United States, where Xarelto‚Ñ¢
is marketed by a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Following its approval in additional indications, sales
of our eye medicine Eylea‚Ñ¢ posted substantial gains, particularly in Europe and Japan. Our cancer drug
Stivarga‚Ñ¢ benefited from positive development in the United States and from the reversal of a rebate
provision in France. An encouraging contribution to sales growth was made by our cancer drug
Xofigo‚Ñ¢, thanks primarily to the expansion of volumes in the United States. Sales of Adempas‚Ñ¢ (2015:
‚Ç¨181 million; 2014: ‚Ç¨89 million) to treat various forms of pulmonary hypertension rose substantially,
especially in the United States. This figure reflects the proportionate recognition of the one-time payment resulting from the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., United States.
Growth in sales of the hormone-releasing intrauterine devices of the Mirena‚Ñ¢ product family ‚Äì Mirena‚Ñ¢
and Jaydess‚Ñ¢ / Skyla‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì resulted especially from higher demand in the United States. The cancer drug
Nexavar‚Ñ¢ posted sales gains, particularly in the United States and Germany. Adalat‚Ñ¢ for the treatment
of hypertension and coronary heart disease, Aspirin‚Ñ¢ Cardio for secondary prevention of heart attacks
and our oral diabetes treatment Glucobay‚Ñ¢ continued to benefit from strong demand in China.
Sales of our blood-clotting medicine Kogenate‚Ñ¢ were down slightly year on year, receding by 1.1%
(Fx adj.), due mainly to the temporary use of production capacities to develop our next-generation hemophilia medicines. Increased competition caused sales of our multiple sclerosis drug Betaferon‚Ñ¢ /
Betaseron‚Ñ¢ to decline in all regions, mainly Europe and the United States. Business with our yaz‚Ñ¢ /
Yasmin‚Ñ¢ / Yasminelle‚Ñ¢ oral contraceptives was held back especially by generic competition in Europe
and the United States. Sales of the antibiotic Avalox‚Ñ¢ / Avelox‚Ñ¢ fell, particularly in Europe and the United States, following the expiration of patent protection during 2014. Sales of the erectile dysfunction
treatment Levitra‚Ñ¢ also receded.

Bayer Annual Report 2015

13. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

ebit of the Pharmaceuticals segment rose by a substantial 18.4% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨2,807 million. Special
charges of ‚Ç¨254 million (2014: ‚Ç¨286 million) mostly comprised ‚Ç¨126 million for efficiency improvement
measures, ‚Ç¨67 million for the revaluation of other receivables and ‚Ç¨43 million for the impairment loss on
a research project. ebit before special items increased by 15.2% to ‚Ç¨3,061 million. ebitda before special items improved by 13.4% to ‚Ç¨4,195 million. This earnings increase was primarily attributable to the
very good development of business, particularly for our recently launched products, and to positive
currency effects of about ‚Ç¨140 million. As expected, earnings were diminished by higher research and
development expenses.

Business in the Consumer Care Division improved by 6.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨6,076 million. Sales
of our analgesic Aspirin‚Ñ¢ were up slightly against the prior year, due particularly to gains in Latin
America and Europe that more than offset the decline in the United States. We grew sales of our analgesic Aleve‚Ñ¢, mainly because of price and volume increases in Latin America / Africa / Middle East. Our
skincare product Bepanthen‚Ñ¢ / Bepanthol‚Ñ¢ posted considerably higher sales, particularly in the Emerging Markets. Business with our antifungal product Canesten‚Ñ¢ showed pleasing development thanks to
expanded volumes in all regions. The Alka-Seltzer‚Ñ¢ family of products to treat gastric complaints and
cold symptoms registered a decline in demand particularly in the United States that was due partly to a
weaker cold season.

13. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

We achieved sales of ‚Ç¨1,770 million in 2015 with the business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc., United
States, including ‚Ç¨380 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (q4 2014: ‚Ç¨289 million). We substantially
raised sales of our antihistamine Claritin‚Ñ¢ compared with the fourth quarter of the previous year, thanks
in part to an extended allergy season in the United States. Driven mainly by higher prices in the United
States, business with our Dr. Scholl‚Äôs‚Ñ¢2 foot care products also showed pleasing development.
Sales of the Medical Care Division increased by 2.9% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨1,563 million, mainly as a
result of positive development in the United States. Business with our mri contrast agent Gadovist‚Ñ¢
showed encouraging growth in all regions.
Sales of the Animal Health Division rose by 4.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨1,490 million. Our Seresto‚Ñ¢
flea and tick collar made a significant contribution to this development, particularly in the United States
and Europe. Sales of the Advantage‚Ñ¢ family of flea, tick and worm control products receded slightly,
however, mainly due to increased competition.
ebit of the Consumer Health segment improved by 13.1% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨1,243 million. Special charges
amounted to ‚Ç¨346 million (2014: ‚Ç¨45 million) and mainly comprised ‚Ç¨225 million in integration costs for
acquired businesses, ‚Ç¨76 million for efficiency improvement measures and ‚Ç¨41 million in costs associated with the relocation of a production facility. ebit before special items significantly rose by 38.9% to
‚Ç¨1,589 million. ebitda before special items improved by a substantial 34.1% to ‚Ç¨2,224 million. The
earnings contributions from the expansion of business in all divisions and positive currency effects of
‚Ç¨110 million were partly offset in particular by higher selling expenses associated especially with the
newly acquired consumer care businesses.

SeedGrowth. In the Seeds business, sales of soybean and canola seed developed particularly well.
Business in Environmental Science advanced by 4.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨819 million. There was a
sharp increase in business with products for professional users, while the consumer business came in at
the prior-year level.

The sales development of CropScience varied by region.
Sales in Europe rose by 8.2% (Fx adj.) to ‚Ç¨3,123 million, driven by the positive development at Crop
Protection / Seeds. Sales at Herbicides grew by a double-digit percentage, and business at Fungicides
also expanded significantly due to low inventories at the beginning of the year. In addition, we achieved
encouraging gains in our canola and vegetable seed businesses. Environmental Science performed
positively due to strong business with products for professional users.

162

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
13. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Sales in the North America region declined by 1.6% (Fx adj.) to ‚Ç¨2,689 million. This decline was chiefly attributable to the negative development at Crop Protection, particularly at SeedGrowth, which in turn
resulted from high inventories of already treated seed in the market. Business was also down for cotton
seed, fungicides and herbicides. On the other hand, business with canola seed expanded briskly compared with the prior year. Our insecticides business also developed successfully. There was a very significant increase in sales at Environmental Science, especially due to the acquisition of parts of the
DuPont land management business.
Sales in the Asia / Pacific region came in slightly above the prior year level at ‚Ç¨1,531 million (Fx adj.
+1.3%). Contributing to this increase in particular were our SeedGrowth and Herbicides businesses.
Sales of cotton and vegetable seed improved by double-digit percentages. Sales at Insecticides declined
slightly against the previous year. Sales at Environmental Science were down year on year.
Despite a weakened market environment, particularly in Brazil, sales in Latin America / Africa / Middle
East were level year on year at ‚Ç¨3,024 million (Fx adj. ‚Äì0.5%). Sales at Insecticides receded sharply
as a result of declining business in Latin America that was mainly attributable to lower infestation
pressure in Brazil. Business was also down at SeedGrowth, an effect that could not be fully offset by
double-digit-percentage growth in sales at Fungicides and a very gratifying performance of the Seeds
business, especially for soybean and vegetable seed. Sales at Environmental Science also moved
ahead by a double-digit percentage.

were net special gains of ‚Ç¨222 million (2014: net special charges of ‚Ç¨32 million), comprising mainly
damage and license payments in connection with the infringement of Bayer‚Äôs rights to the LibertyLink
weed control system by Dow AgroSciences (das). ebit before special items increased by 2.3% to
‚Ç¨1,881 million. ebitda before special items improved by 2.4% to ‚Ç¨2,416 million. In addition to positive
earnings effects due to the satisfactory business development, including higher volumes and slightly
improved selling prices, there was a very positive currency effect of about ‚Ç¨220 million. By contrast,
there was an increase in the cost of goods sold and in research and development expenses.

Covestro registered a 5.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) decline in sales in 2015, to ‚Ç¨11,982 million (reported:
+2.8%). This decline resulted from lower selling prices in all business units, particularly Polyurethanes.
On the other hand, Covestro expanded volumes in all business units.

The Polyurethanes business unit saw sales fall by 10.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨6,084 million. This
decline resulted from much lower selling prices for the three product groups toluene diisocyanate (tdi),
diphenylmethane diisocyanate (mdi) and polyether polyols (pet). Volumes came in slightly above the
prior-year level overall.
The Polycarbonates business unit raised sales by 2.0% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to ‚Ç¨3,169 million. This
growth was due to positive volume development, while selling prices were down only slightly.
Sales in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties business unit moved forward by 1.5% (Fx & portfolio
adj.) to ‚Ç¨2,092 million. Slightly higher volumes more than offset the effect of modestly lower selling

ebit of Covestro climbed by 14.4% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨635 million (2014: ‚Ç¨555 million). This figure reflected
special charges of ‚Ç¨332 million (2014: ‚Ç¨43 million) for restructuring measures, chiefly for the carve-out
and stock market flotation of Covestro and for the consolidation of production sites. ebit before special
items climbed by a substantial 61.7% to ‚Ç¨967 million. ebitda before special items also clearly improved by 39.8% to ‚Ç¨1,659 million. Considerably lower raw material prices more than offset the decline
in selling prices. This was due to a more advantageous supply and demand situation, particularly at
Polycarbonates. We also expanded volumes. Furthermore, earnings were buoyed by positive currency
effects of about ‚Ç¨240 million.

Emerging Markets‚Äô share of total CropScience sales in 2015 was 46.6% (2014: 46.4%).
COVESTRO
Sales of Covestro in the Emerging Markets declined by 5.7% (Fx adj.) in 2015 to ‚Ç¨5,089 million (2014:
‚Ç¨4,951 million). Sales in the Asia region remained well below the prior-year level on a currency-adjusted
basis, and also declined in Latin America. We expanded sales in the Eastern Europe and Africa / Middle
East regions. The Emerging Markets‚Äô share of total sales at Covestro was 42.5% (2014: 42.5%).
We additionally engage in some Emerging Markets through regional economic development projects, as
shown by the examples contained in 
RQOLQHDQQH[
CropScience aims to contribute to increased agricultural productivity in regions such as Africa and
intends to expand its presence there. Our offerings are tailored to the needs of African farmers and
range from integrated crop solutions based on improved seed varieties through modern crop protection technologies and training in good agricultural practice and environmental protection to product
safety programs. We also engage locally in public-private partnerships (ppps) to help increase the income of smallholder farmers through sustainable agriculture. Activities include expanding local value chains and training measures. This contributes to improving the living situation of the local population and enhancing the availability of staple foods in the project countries. In such ppps, we cooperate with numerous partners including local governments, farmers‚Äô associations and cooperatives,
nongovernmental organizations and agricultural input industries. CropScience is currently participating in ppps associated with the value chains for rice and potatoes in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and
Southeast Asia.

Together with representatives of globalg.a.p., one of the world‚Äôs leading quality assurance systems,
CropScience has continued developing the Bayg.a.p. program to provide smallholder farmers in developing countries and Emerging Markets, for example, with access to professional local and global
food markets. In 2015, pilot projects were carried out with food chain partners in the Asia / Pacific
and Latin America regions. The service program includes an intensive training course in good agricultural practice (g.a.p.), individual cultivation advice and subsequent support in meeting the respective local g.a.p. standard. The farmers can sell certified, high-quality produce at higher prices, thus
raising their incomes.
In cooperation with external partners, Covestro is evolving and implementing technical solutions to
help low-income people in developing countries and Emerging Markets gain improved access to
high-quality, safe and easy-to-build yet affordable housing. These activities currently focus on Asia.
The company is mainly contributing its expertise in the field of rigid polyurethane foam for the construction industry.

Sales of the Bayer Group rose to ‚Ç¨46,324 million (+12.1%). The increase after adjusting for currency
and portfolio effects was 2.7%.
The cost of goods sold increased by 6.3% to ‚Ç¨21,158 million, mainly due to currency and portfolio
effects that drove up costs. Lower raw material costs at Covestro had an opposing effect. The ratio of the
cost of goods sold to total sales was 45.7% (2014: 48.2%). The selling expenses of ‚Ç¨12,367 million
(+ 15.9%) amounted to 26.7% of sales (2014: 25.8%). Research and development (r&d) expenses rose
in 2015 by 21.0% to ‚Ç¨4,281 million, the increase being attributable above all to higher r&d investment
at Pharmaceuticals. The ratio of r&d expenses to sales was 9.2% (2014: 8.6%). General administration

expenses climbed by 23.2% to ‚Ç¨2,098 million. The ratio of general administration expenses to total
sales therefore increased to 4.5% (2014: 4.1%). The increased other operating expenses of
‚Ç¨170 million (2014: ‚Ç¨126 million) resulted mainly from negative effects from derivatives to hedge
planned sales that were partly offset by a special gain from damage and license payments in connection
with the infringement by Dow AgroSciences of Bayer‚Äôs rights to the Liberty Link‚Ñ¢ weed control system.
ebit climbed by 15.8% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨6,250 million.
The financial result declined by 2.4% to minus ‚Ç¨1,005 million. It comprised ‚Ç¨455 million (2014:
‚Ç¨356 million) in net interest expense, ‚Ç¨287 million (2014: ‚Ç¨322 million) in interest cost for pension and
other provisions, and a ‚Ç¨254 million (2014: ‚Ç¨248 million) net exchange loss. The increase in net interest
expense was primarily attributable to higher financing costs in connection with the acquired consumer
care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States.
Tax expense in 2015 increased to ‚Ç¨1,227 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,071 million). Income after income taxes
came in at ‚Ç¨4,098 million. Income attributable to noncontrolling interest fell by ‚Ç¨29 million to minus
‚Ç¨12 million. Bayer Group net income for 2015 was ‚Ç¨4,110 million (2014: ‚Ç¨3,426 million).

14.2 Calculation of EBIT(DA) Before Special Items
ebit (income after income taxes, plus income taxes, plus financial result), which is not defined in the
International Financial Reporting Standards, is influenced by one-time special effects and by the amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, along with impairment
losses and impairment loss reversals. To elucidate the effects of these parameters on the operational
business and facilitate the comparability of operational earning power over time, we determine additional
indicators: ebitda, ebit before special items, ebitda before special items and the ebitda margin before
special items. These indicators also are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards.
ebitda (ebit plus the amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property, plant and
equipment, plus impairment losses and minus impairment loss reversals, recognized in profit or loss
during the reporting period) serves to characterize the operational business irrespective of the effects of
amortization, depreciation or impairment losses/impairment loss reversals.
ebit before special items and ebitda before special items show the development of the operational
business irrespective of the effects of special items ‚Äì those that are nonrecurring or do not regularly
recur or attain similar magnitudes. ebit before special items and ebitda before special items are determined by adding special charges and subtracting special gains. They constitute relevant key data for
Bayer.
The ebitda margin before special items, which is calculated by dividing ebitda before special items by
sales, serves as an indicator of relative operational earning power for purposes of internal and external
comparison.
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were 14.1% higher in 2015 at ‚Ç¨3,333 million (2014:
‚Ç¨2,920 million), comprising ‚Ç¨1,802 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,581 million) in amortization and impairments on
intangible assets and ‚Ç¨1,531 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,339 million) in depreciation and impairments on property, plant and equipment. A total of ‚Ç¨136 million (2014: ‚Ç¨68 million) in impairments constituted special
items.

14.3 Core Earnings per Share
Earnings per share according to ifrs are affected by the purchase price allocation for acquisitions and
other special factors. To demonstrate the impact of these effects on earnings and facilitate the comparability of our performance over time, we determine additional indicators ‚Äì core ebit, core net income and
core earnings per share ‚Äì which are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards.

171

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
14. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group

Core ebit is determined by first eliminating from ebit (income after income taxes, plus income taxes,
plus financial result), which is not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards, all amortization and impairment losses / impairment loss reversals on intangible assets, impairment losses / impairment loss reversals on property, plant and equipment, and special items (other than amortization
and impairment losses / impairment loss reversals). This core ebit is then used to calculate core net
income, which comprises the financial result (as per income statements), income taxes (as per income
statements), income after income taxes attributable to noncontrolling interest (as per income statements), special items in the financial result, special items in income taxes, tax effects related to amortization, impairment losses / impairment loss reversals and special items, and the above-mentioned adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest.
From this core net income we calculate core earnings per share in the same way as earnings per share.
Core earnings per share form the basis for our dividend policy. Core earnings per share are determined
for both continuing and discontinued operations. In 2015, we improved core earnings per share from
continuing operations by 16.0% to ‚Ç¨6.83 (2014: ‚Ç¨5.89).

14.4 Value Management
SYSTEM BASED ON CASH VALUE ADDED
The principal value-based steering parameters in the Bayer Group are the cash value added (cva) and
the cash flow return on investment (cfroi). If the cva is positive, the respective company or business
entity has exceeded the minimum requirements of the equity and debt capital providers and has created
value. The cfroi is a ratio indicating the profitability of the Group or of individual business entities and
must be compared to the cost of capital.
CALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL
Bayer calculates the cost of capital according to the debt / equity ratio at the beginning of the year using
the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) formula. The cost of equity capital is the return expected by
stockholders, computed from capital market information. The cost of debt capital used in calculating the
wacc is based on the terms for ten-year Eurobonds issued by industrial companies with an ‚Äúa‚Äì‚Äù rating.

7.6%
Cost of capital for the
Bayer Group

To take into account the different risk and return profiles of our principal businesses, we calculate
individual capital cost factors after income taxes for each of our subgroups. These were 7.9% for
HealthCare, 7.3% for CropScience and 6.9% for Covestro. The capital cost factor for the Group as a
whole in 2015 was 7.6%.
GROSS CASH FLOW, CASH VALUE ADDED AND CASH FLOW RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS
PERFORMANCE YARDSTICKS
The gross cash flow is the measure of our internal financing capability. Bayer has chosen this parameter
because it is relatively free of accounting influences and is therefore a more meaningful performance
indicator.

Positive CVA =
value created

Taking into account the costs of capital and of reproducing depletable assets, we determine the gross
cash flow hurdle. If the gross cash flow hurdle is exceeded, the cva is positive and thus the required
return on equity and debt plus the cost of asset reproduction has been earned.
The cfroi is the difference between the gross cash flow and the cost of reproducing depletable assets,
divided by the capital invested. The capital invested is calculated from the statement of financial position and basically comprises the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets required for operations ‚Äì stated at the historical cost of acquisition or construction ‚Äì plus working capital, less interestfree liabilities (such as current provisions). To mitigate the effect of fluctuations in the capital invested
during the year, the cfroi is computed on the basis of the average capital invested for the respective
year.
The gross cash flow hurdle for 2015 was ‚Ç¨5,714 million.
Actual gross cash flow came in at ‚Ç¨6,999 million, exceeding the hurdle by 22.5%. Thus the entire cost
of capital and asset reproduction costs were earned in 2015. The positive cva of ‚Ç¨1,285 million shows
that Bayer exceeded the minimum return and reproduction requirements and created value. A cfroi of
9.6% was achieved in 2015.
Despite negative impact from special items in some cases, all the subgroups exceeded their required
returns (including asset reproduction), achieved a positive cva and thus helped to increase the company‚Äôs value.

amortization and impairment losses, minus impairment loss reversals, plus / minus changes in pension provisions, minus gains / plus losses on
retirements of noncurrent assets, minus gains from the remeasurement of already held assets in step acquisitions. The change in pension
provisions includes the elimination of noncash components of EBIT. It also contains benefit payments during the year. Gross cash flow is not
defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards.

OPERATING CASH FLOW
Gross cash flow is not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards.
Gross cash flow from continuing operations climbed by 4.4% in 2015 to ‚Ç¨6,999 million (2014:
‚Ç¨6,707 million), mainly because of the improvement in ebitda. Net cash flow (total) rose by 18.6% to
‚Ç¨6,890 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,810 million) due to a sharp decrease in additional cash tied up in working
capital. Income taxes paid in 2015 amounted to ‚Ç¨1,699 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,835 million).
INVESTING CASH FLOW
Net cash outflow for investing activities in 2015 amounted to ‚Ç¨2,762 million. Cash outflows for property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets were 6.2% higher at ‚Ç¨2,517 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,371 million)
and included ‚Ç¨969 million (2014: ‚Ç¨832 million) at HealthCare, ‚Ç¨722 million (2014: ‚Ç¨686 million) at
CropScience and ‚Ç¨508 million (2014: ‚Ç¨605 million) at Covestro. The ‚Ç¨176 million (2014:
‚Ç¨13,545 million) in outflows for acquisitions mainly related to the purchase of SeedWorks India Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad, India, and further payments in connection with the purchase of the consumer care business

These include short-term loans and receivables with maturities between 3 and 12 months outstanding from banks and other companies as well as
available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial investments that were recorded as current on initial recognition.

Net financial debt is not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards and is calculated as
shown above.
In 2015, net financial debt of the Bayer Group decreased by 11.0% to ‚Ç¨17.4 billion. Cash inflows from
operating activities and the stock market flotation of Covestro were partly offset by cash outflows for
dividends and negative currency effects. As of December 31, 2015, the Group had cash and cash
equivalents of ‚Ç¨1.9 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨1.9 billion). Financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period
amounted to ‚Ç¨19.6 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨21.6 billion), with three subordinated hybrid bonds reflected at
‚Ç¨4.5 billion overall. Net financial debt should be viewed against the fact that Moody‚Äôs and Standard &
Poor‚Äôs treat 50% of the hybrid bonds with nominal volumes of ‚Ç¨1.75 billion and ‚Ç¨1.5 billion issued in
July 2014 and of the hybrid bond with a nominal volume of ‚Ç¨1.3 billion issued in April 2015 as equity.
The hybrid bonds thus have a more limited effect on the Group‚Äôs rating-specific debt indicators than
conventional borrowings. Our noncurrent financial liabilities declined in 2015 from ‚Ç¨18.5 billion to
‚Ç¨16.5 billion, while current financial liabilities remained unchanged at ‚Ç¨3.4 billion.

Total assets as of December 31, 2015, increased by 5.2% to ‚Ç¨73.9 billion. Noncurrent assets rose by
4.4% to ‚Ç¨50.1 billion due mainly to currency effects. The carrying amount of current assets climbed to
‚Ç¨23.8 billion, due mainly to an increase in trade accounts receivable and other receivables.
Equity increased by ‚Ç¨5.2 billion to ‚Ç¨25.4 billion. The positive effects from the net income of ‚Ç¨4.1 billion
(2014: ‚Ç¨3.4 billion), the exchange differences of ‚Ç¨0.7 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨1.4 billion) and the decline of
‚Ç¨0.8 billion (2014: negative effect from the increase of ‚Ç¨3.5 billion) ‚Äì recognized outside profit or loss ‚Äì
in post-employment benefit obligations were offset by the dividend payment of ‚Ç¨1.9 billion (2014:
‚Ç¨1.7 billion). In addition, the capital increase at Covestro as a result of the successful stock market flotation increased equity by ‚Ç¨1.5 billion. The equity ratio (equity coverage of total assets) as of December
31, 2015 was 34.4% (2014: 28.8%).
Liabilities decreased by ‚Ç¨1.5 billion compared with December 31, 2014, to ‚Ç¨48.5 billion. Decreases in
provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits and financial liabilities more than offset
increases in other provisions, trade accounts payable and tax liabilities.

14.7 Financial Management of the Group
The financial management of the Bayer Group is conducted by Bayer AG. Capital is a global resource,
generally procured centrally and distributed within the Group. The foremost objectives of our financial
management are to help bring about a sustained increase in corporate value and to ensure the Group‚Äôs
liquidity and creditworthiness. This involves optimizing the capital structure and effectively managing
risks. The management of currency, interest rate, raw material price and default risks helps to reduce
the volatility of our earnings.

These credit ratings reflect the company‚Äôs high solvency and ensure access to a broad investor base for
financing purposes. It remains our goal to achieve and maintain financial ratios that support an ‚Äúa‚Äù
category rating in order to maintain our financial flexibility.
We pursue a prudent debt management strategy to ensure flexibility, drawing on a balanced financing
portfolio. This is based on bonds ‚Äì predominantly a multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program ‚Äì, syndicated credit facilities, bilateral loan agreements and a global commercial paper program.
We use financial derivatives to hedge against risks arising from business operations or financial transactions, but do not employ contracts in the absence of an underlying transaction. It is our policy to diminish default risks by selecting trading partners with a high credit standing. We closely monitor the execution of all transactions, which are conducted in accordance with Group directives.
Further details of our risk management objectives and the ways in which we account for all the major
types of hedged transactions ‚Äì along with price, credit and liquidity risks as they relate to the use of
financial instruments ‚Äì are given in Chapter 18.3 ‚ÄúOpportunities and Risks Report.‚Äù

15. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position
of Bayer AG
Until the end of 2015, Bayer AG functioned solely as the management holding company for the Bayer
Group. At the beginning of 2016, it assumed responsibility for the operations of its three divisions. As
the parent company of the Bayer Group, Bayer AG ‚Äì represented by its Board of Management ‚Äì performs the principal management functions for the entire Group. These include strategic planning, resource allocation, executive management and financial management. The performance of Bayer AG is
largely determined by the business performance of the Bayer Group.
The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code
(hgb) and Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

In fiscal 2015, the net income of Bayer AG was ‚Ç¨1,361 million, down by ‚Ç¨1,093 million against the previous year (2014: ‚Ç¨2,454 million). Earnings were held back above all by lower income from investments
in affiliated companies and higher tax expense.
The income from investments in affiliated companies declined year on year by ‚Ç¨769 million to
‚Ç¨2,444 million (2014: ‚Ç¨3,213 million). Bayer Pharma AG posted income of ‚Ç¨1,793 million (2014:
‚Ç¨2,158 million), which, as in the previous years, was by far the largest contribution. Despite a substantial increase in business, however, earnings of that company fell by ‚Ç¨365 million, due partly to higher
r&d and selling expenses. Bayer CropScience AG contributed ‚Ç¨964 million (2014: ‚Ç¨787 million) to Bayer
AG‚Äôs income, an increase of ‚Ç¨177 million. This was attributable to a slightly improved earnings contribution from business operations and to one-time gains from a litigation, among other factors. Bayer AG
assumed a loss of ‚Ç¨150 million from Covestro Deutschland AG, the former Bayer MaterialScience AG
(bms), from its abbreviated fiscal year ending in August 2015. That company had made a positive earnings contribution of ‚Ç¨154 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings was mainly due to a
payment of ‚Ç¨217 million to clear compensation claims from Bayer AG for the pension expenses of former bms employees. Other significant earnings contributions comprised ‚Ç¨149 million (2014: ‚Ç¨146 million) from a subsidiary that receives foreign dividend income. The service companies Bayer Business
Services GmbH and Bayer Technology Services GmbH assumed losses of ‚Ç¨118 million (2014: ‚Ç¨75 million) and ‚Ç¨12 million (2014: ‚Ç¨18 million), respectively. The reported loss at Bayer HealthCare AG, the
holding company for the global health care business, was ‚Ç¨231 million (2014: ‚Ç¨207 million).
Net interest expense was ‚Ç¨484 million, an increase of ‚Ç¨143 million compared with the previous year.
After offsetting against gains from the fund assets, just the interest portion of the allocation to pension
provisions led to additional expense of ‚Ç¨142 million, and thus to total expense of ‚Ç¨276 million (2014:
‚Ç¨134 million). Of the remaining ‚Ç¨208 million (2014: ‚Ç¨207 million) balance of interest expenses and
income, ‚Ç¨179 million was attributable to transactions with third parties and ‚Ç¨29 million to intra-Group
transactions.
Other financial income and expenses yielded a positive balance of ‚Ç¨409 million (2014: ‚Ç¨129 million).
This marked increase was due particularly to a payment of ‚Ç¨217 million received from Covestro
Deutschland AG to clear compensation claims from Bayer AG for the pension expenses of former bms
employees. Income from the subgroups and service companies to cover pension expenses for retirees
remaining with Bayer AG following the hive-down of the operating business in 2002 and 2003 amounted to ‚Ç¨178 million (2014: ‚Ç¨180 million). If due to interest rates, pension expenses as such are recognized under interest income / expense; otherwise they are recognized under other financial income and
expenses. There was income of ‚Ç¨15 million in 2015 and expense of ‚Ç¨19 million in the previous year.
Further income of ‚Ç¨6 million (2014: charges of ‚Ç¨20 million) resulted from the translation of foreign
currency receivables and payables and from currency derivatives.

15. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of Bayer AG

General administration expenses relating to Bayer AG‚Äôs performance of its functions as the parent company of the Bayer Group amounted to ‚Ç¨324 million (2014: ‚Ç¨272 million). Miscellaneous operating expenses relating to these functions, net of the respective miscellaneous operating income, came to ‚Ç¨78
million (2014: ‚Ç¨19 million). Of the higher expenses totaling ‚Ç¨111 million, ‚Ç¨83 million was in connection
with the carve-out and stock market flotation of Covestro.
Pre-tax income decreased to ‚Ç¨1,967 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,710 million). Tax expense nonetheless increased
from ‚Ç¨256 million to ‚Ç¨606 million on account of effects associated with the formation of the Covestro
Group and lower tax-free income from investments in affiliated companies. After deduction of taxes, net
income was ‚Ç¨1,361 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,454 million). A withdrawal of ‚Ç¨706 million was made from other
retained earnings, leaving a distributable profit of ‚Ç¨2,067 million.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on
April 29, 2016 that the distributable profit be used to pay a dividend of ‚Ç¨2.50 per share (826,947,808
shares) on the capital stock of ‚Ç¨2,117 million entitled to the dividend for 2015.

15. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of Bayer AG

The asset and liability structure of Bayer AG is dominated by its role in managing the subsidiaries and
financing corporate activities as the parent company of the Bayer Group. This is primarily reflected in
the high level of investments in affiliated companies and of the receivables from, and payables to, Group
companies.
Total assets of Bayer AG as of December 31, 2015 were ‚Ç¨48.0 billion, up from ‚Ç¨45.4 billion at the start of
the year because of the ‚Ç¨2.8 billion increase in noncurrent assets. By contrast, current assets decreased
by ‚Ç¨0.3 billion in fiscal 2015.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled ‚Ç¨31 million (2014: ‚Ç¨18 million) and were
therefore of secondary importance. Financial assets increased by ‚Ç¨2.8 billion to ‚Ç¨43.7 billion (2014:
‚Ç¨40.9 billion), principally as a result of capital increases at subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies continued to account for by far the largest item in total assets, amounting to 89.5% (2014:
88.3%).
Receivables from subsidiaries amounted to ‚Ç¨3.2 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨2.7 billion) while payables to subsidiaries totaled ‚Ç¨22.8 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨18.2 billion). These amounts accounted for 6.6% of total assets and
47.5% of total equity and liabilities, respectively.
Including the deferred charges, the other receivables reflected in current assets, at ‚Ç¨380 million, were
below the prior-year level of ‚Ç¨460 million and were of only secondary importance in relation to total
assets. Cash and cash equivalents were ‚Ç¨614 million lower than in the previous year at ‚Ç¨629 million
(2014: ‚Ç¨1,243 million) due to lower bank deposits.
Bayer AG had equity of ‚Ç¨15.0 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨15.5 billion). The decline in equity, coupled with the increase in total assets, caused the equity ratio to fall to 31.4% (2014: 34.2%). Net income for 2015 was
‚Ç¨1,361 million while equity was diminished by the ‚Ç¨1,861 million dividend payment for 2014.
Provisions were level year on year at ‚Ç¨2.4 billion. While pension provisions decreased by ‚Ç¨306 million to
‚Ç¨1,562 million, tax provisions were ‚Ç¨265 million higher at ‚Ç¨664 million. The other provisions were virtually unchanged at ‚Ç¨130 million (2014: ‚Ç¨139 million).
Other liabilities rose by ‚Ç¨3.1 billion to ‚Ç¨30.5 billion (net of deductible receivables; 2014: ‚Ç¨27.4 billion),
mainly due to the ‚Ç¨2.1 billion increase in financial debt. In this connection, external debt of the Group
was reduced at the expense of higher debt to Group companies. Internal financial debt rose by
‚Ç¨3.2 billion. Bonds in the same amount of ‚Ç¨1.3 billion were issued and repaid in fiscal 2015. The use of
funds from the commercial paper program decreased by ‚Ç¨1.1 billion. Total financial debt at year end
2015 was ‚Ç¨30.3 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨28.2 billion). After deduction of cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨0.6 billion,
net debt was ‚Ç¨2.7 billion higher than in the previous year at ‚Ç¨29.7 billion (2014: ‚Ç¨27.0 billion).

BAYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GERMAN CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE CODE
Bayer has always placed great importance on responsible corporate governance. This will remain the
case in the future. In 2015, the company was again able to issue a declaration that it had fully complied
with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the past and continued to do
so.
In 2015, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board again addressed the question of compliance
with the German Corporate Governance Code, including the Code amendments of May 5, 2015. The
resulting declaration, which is reproduced on the previous page, was issued in December 2015 and
posted on Bayer‚Äôs website along with previous declarations.
DUTIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
The Board of Management runs the company on its own responsibility with the goal of sustainably
increasing the company‚Äôs enterprise value and achieving the defined corporate objectives. The Board of
Management performs its tasks according to the law, the Articles of Incorporation and the Board‚Äôs rules
of procedure, and works with the company‚Äôs other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.
The Board of Management of Bayer AG defines the long-term goals and strategies for the company and
the Group and sets forth the principles and directives for the resulting corporate policies. It coordinates
and monitors the most important activities, defines the portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff,
allocates resources and decides on the Group‚Äôs financial steering and reporting.
The members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole.
However, the individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within
the framework of the decisions made by the full Board. The allocation of functions among the members
of the Board of Management is defined in a written schedule.
The full Board of Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases
where a decision of the full Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure
of the Board of Management contain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the full
Board.
Meetings of the Board of Management are held regularly. They are convened by the Chairman of the
Board of Management. Any member of the Board of Management may also demand that a meeting be
convened. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the votes cast, except
where unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the casting vote.
According to the Board of Management‚Äôs rules of procedure and the functional responsibilities assigned
to its members, the Chairman bears particular responsibility for leading and coordinating the Board‚Äôs
work. He represents the company and the Group in dealings with third parties and the workforce on
matters relating to more than one part of the company or the Group. He also bears special responsibility
for certain corporate functions.
In 2015 special responsibility was assigned to different members of the Board of Management for each
of the following functions:
x
x
x
x

Strategy and Portfolio Management
Finance
Human Resources, Technology & Sustainability (this member also serving as Labor Director)

In addition, three of the members of the Board of Management were each responsible for geographical
regions.
Effective January 1, 2016, functional responsibilities were reallocated in light of the Bayer Group‚Äôs sole
focus on the Life Science business and the enlargement of the Board of Management by three members.
In addition to the function of Board Chairman and the four other existing functions, three functions
were created that each have special responsibility for one of the operating divisions. Responsibilities for
the geographical regions were redistributed among four members.
See Chapter 4 for
more about the
Bayer Life Science
Center

A Deal Committee was established within the Board of Management to make the final decisions on
corporate acquisitions, divestments or licensing transactions above a defined medium size. The membership of this committee varies from case to case. The members responsible for Strategy and Portfolio
Management and for Finance always participate in its decision-making. The third member of the Board
of Management involved in the decisions of the Deal Committee is either the member responsible for
the division to which the transaction relates or ‚Äì in the case of a transaction of the Bayer Life Science
Center ‚Äì the member responsible for Innovation. There are no other committees within the Board of
Management.
SUPERVISORY BOARD: OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS
The role of the 20-member Supervisory Board is to oversee and advise the Board of Management. Under
the German Codetermination Act, half of the Supervisory Board‚Äôs members are elected by the stockholders, and half by the company‚Äôs employees. The Supervisory Board is directly involved in decisions on
matters of fundamental importance to the company, regularly conferring with the Board of Management
on the company‚Äôs strategic alignment and the implementation status of the business strategy.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and presides over the meetings. Through
regular discussions with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is kept constantly informed
about business policy, corporate planning and strategy. The Supervisory Board approves the annual
budget and financial framework. It also approves the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group along with the combined management report, taking into
account the reports by the auditor.
COMMITTEES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board has the following committees:
Presidial Committee: This comprises the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board along
with a further stockholder representative and a further employee representative. The Presidial Committee serves primarily as the mediation committee pursuant to the German Codetermination Act. It has the
task of submitting proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of
Management if the necessary two-thirds majority is not achieved in the first vote at a plenary meeting.
Certain decision-making powers in connection with capital measures, including the power to amend the
Articles of Incorporation accordingly, have also been delegated to this committee.
Audit Committee: The Audit Committee comprises three stockholder representatives and three employee representatives. The Chairman of the Audit Committee in 2015, Dr. Klaus Sturany, satisfies the
statutory requirements concerning the independence and the expertise in the field of accounting or
auditing that a member of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee is required to possess. The
Audit Committee meets regularly four times a year. Its tasks include oversight of the company‚Äôs financial reporting process, the effectiveness and ongoing development of the internal control system, the
risk management system, the internal audit system, the compliance system and the audit of the financial
statements. It prepares the decisions of the Supervisory Board pertaining to the financial statements of
Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group, the combined management report,
the proposal for the use of the distributable profit of Bayer AG, and the interim financial statements and
management reports of the Bayer Group, all of which are prepared by the Board of Management. On the
basis of the auditor‚Äôs report on the audit of the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report, the Audit Committee develops proposals concerning the approval of both sets of financial statements by the full Supervisory

185

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

Board. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the company‚Äôs relationship with the external auditor. The Audit Committee submits a proposal to the full Supervisory Board concerning the auditor‚Äôs
appointment, prepares the awarding of the audit contract to the audit firm appointed by the Annual
Stockholders‚Äô Meeting, suggests areas of focus for the audit and determines the auditor‚Äôs remuneration.
It also monitors the independence, qualifications, rotation and efficiency of the auditor.
Human Resources Committee: On this committee, too, there is parity of representation between stockholders and employees. It consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other Supervisory Board members. The Human Resources Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory Board, which resolves on appointments or revocations of appointments of members of the
Board of Management. The Human Resources Committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board
on the service contracts of the members of the Board of Management. However, it is the task of the full
Supervisory Board to resolve on the total compensation of the individual members of the Board of Management and the respective compensation components, as well as to regularly review the compensation
system on the basis of recommendations submitted by the Human Resources Committee. The Human
Resources Committee also discusses the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management.
Nominations Committee: This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder
representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held. It suggests suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting for election. The Nominations Committee
comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the other stockholder representative on the Presidial Committee.
Innovation Committee: The Innovation Committee was established in September 2015. It is primarily
concerned with the innovation strategy and innovation management, the strategy for protection of intellectual property, and major research and development programs. Within its area of responsibility, the
Committee advises and oversees the management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions. The
Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and five other members of the Supervisory Board, with parity of representation between stockholder and employee representatives.
Detailed information on the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees is provided in the Report
of the Supervisory Board on page 34 of this Annual Report.
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that its members together possess the necessary expertise, skills and professional experience to properly perform their duties. In view of Bayer AG‚Äôs
global operations, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal of always having several members with
international business experience or an international background. A further objective concerning the
composition of the Supervisory Board is that, absent special circumstances, a member should not hold
office beyond the end of the next Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting following his or her 72nd birthday.
With a view to avoiding potential conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal that
more than half of the stockholder representatives be independent and also that at least three quarters of
the total Supervisory Board membership (stockholder and employee representatives) be independent.
The Supervisory Board assesses the independence of its members according to the recommendation
contained in Section 5.4.2 of the the German Corporate Governance Code. In assessing independence,
the Supervisory Board also considers the criteria given in the recommendation of the European Commission of February 15, 2005.4 Finally, the Supervisory Board has set a standard limit on the duration of
any person‚Äôs membership of the Supervisory Board in line with the recommendation in Section 5.4.1,
Paragraph 2 (May 5, 2015 version of the Code). Absent special circumstances, no person should remain
a member of the Supervisory Board for more than three full terms of office. For members of the Supervisory Board serving at the time the standard limit was introduced (September 2015) who have already

Annex 2 to the recommendation of the European Commission of February 15, 2005, on the role of nonexecutive or supervisory directors of listed
companies and on the committees of the (supervisory) board (2005/162/EC)

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report

exceeded this limit or will exceed it by the end of their current term of office, the limit will be applied
with effect from the conclusion of their current term of office.
The stated goals refer to the Supervisory Board as a whole unless specified otherwise. However, since
the Supervisory Board can only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives, the
goals can only be taken into account in these nominations.
Upon elections to the Supervisory Board to be held after January 1, 2016, it must be ensured that at
least 30% of the members are women and at least 30% are men.
Implementation status of the objectives
The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience and other international connections. The objective that a member should step down from the Supervisory Board at the
Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting following his or her 72nd birthday ‚Äì absent special circumstances ‚Äì is
being met. One member, Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker, who has been elected to serve until the Annual
Stockholders‚Äô Meeting in 2016, had already reached 72 years of age at the time of the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting in 2014. However, he was proposed for reelection at that Meeting so that the Supervisory Board would continue to have one member with particular expertise in research until one or more
members with similar experience can be appointed. One member of the Supervisory Board, Werner
Wenning, served as Chairman of the company‚Äôs Board of Management until 2010. One member, ErnstLudwig Winnacker, has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1997, and thus has served more
than three terms of office. However, neither Werner Wenning nor Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker has any
personal or business relationship with the company or a governance body of the company that in the
opinion of the Supervisory Board gives rise to a material conflict of interest of a more than temporary
nature. There are no indications of any possible lack of independence in the case of the other Supervisory Board members. Thus the Supervisory Board considers all of its members to be independent. The
proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently 20%. It is planned to nominate a further
female candidate for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting in 2016. If
this candidate is elected, the proportion of women among the stockholder representatives will rise to
30% and on the full Supervisory Board to 25%.
TARGETS REGARDING THE PROPORTION OF WOMEN ON THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
AND THE FIRST TWO MANAGEMENT LEVELS
The Supervisory Board aims to ensure that there is at least one woman serving on the company‚Äôs Board
of Management. This corresponds to a share of 12.5% on the eight-member Board. The Board of Management has set targets of 20% women on the first management level and 28% women on the second
management level. These targets are to be attained by June 30, 2017.
DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT OR SUPERVISORY BOARD
Members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board and their close relatives are required by
law to disclose all transactions involving the purchase or sale of Bayer stock where such transactions
total ‚Ç¨5,000 or more in a calendar year. Bayer publishes details of such transactions immediately on its
website and also notifies the German Financial Supervisory Authority accordingly. This information is
provided to the company register for archiving. The following transactions in 2015 were reported to

COMMON VALUES AND LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES
Bayer has committed itself to the values of Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency, or ‚Äúlife‚Äù for
short. These values provide guidance to all Bayer employees, both for business dealings and for their
collaboration within the company. All employees are obligated to align their work to the life values.
This is taken into account in human resources development and the regular performance evaluations.
SYSTEMATIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management forms an integral part of our control processes. It ensures that we are mindful of risks
involved in our activities and can identify any financial or nonfinancial risks at an early stage. We attempt to avoid or mitigate risks by taking appropriate countermeasures, or to transfer them to third
parties (such as insurers) to the extent possible and economically acceptable.
The internal control system (ics) applied to our accounting processes enables timely risk monitoring. This ensures the accuracy of our financial reporting along with the prevention or, where necessary,
rectification of errors in the processing of business transactions. It also ensures the availability of reliable data on the company‚Äôs financial situation.
However, the control and risk management system cannot provide absolute protection against losses
arising from business risks or fraudulent actions.

G4-26

DETAILED REPORTING
To maximize transparency, we provide regular and timely information on the Group‚Äôs position and significant changes in business activities to stockholders, financial analysts, stockholders‚Äô associations, the
media and the general public. Bayer complies with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance
Code by publishing reports on business trends, financial position, results of operations and related risks
four times a year.
In line with statutory requirements, the members of the company‚Äôs Board of Management provide an assurance that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial
statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report provide a true and fair view.
The financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the
combined management report are published within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. In addition,
stockholders and other interested parties are kept informed of developments during the fiscal year by
means of financial reports issued for the half-year and the first and third quarters within 45 days after
the end of the respective reporting period. The half-year financial report is voluntarily subjected to an
audit review by the auditor, whose appointment by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting also relates specifically to this audit review.
In addition, Bayer provides information at news conferences and analysts‚Äô meetings. The company also
uses the internet as a platform for the timely announcement of the issue dates of major publications,
such as the annual report and the quarterly financial reports (interim reports), and the date of the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting.
In line with the fair disclosure principle, all stockholders and the other main target groups are treated
equally as regards the communication of valuation-relevant information. All significant new facts are
disclosed immediately to the general public. Stockholders also have immediate access to the information
Bayer publishes locally in compliance with the respective stock market regulations.
In addition to our regular reporting, we issue ad-hoc statements on developments that otherwise might
not become publicly known but have the potential to materially affect the price of Bayer stock.

16.3 Compliance
Bayer manages its businesses responsibly and in accordance with the statutory requirements of the
countries in which it operates.
We define compliance as legally and ethically impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work,
because the way they carry out their duties affects the company‚Äôs reputation. Bayer does not tolerate
any violation of applicable laws, relevant codes of conduct or internal regulations. Compliance is essential for our long-term economic success.

189

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE
The Board of Management is unreservedly committed to compliance, and Bayer will forgo any business
transaction that would violate our compliance principles. These principles are enshrined in our Corporate Compliance Policy, which is available in 42 languages and sets out our commitment to:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Fair competition
Integrity in business dealings ‚Äì including zero tolerance of corruption
The principles of sustainability and product stewardship
The upholding of foreign trade laws and insider trading laws
The separation of business and personal interests
Proper record-keeping and transparent financial reporting
Fair and respectful working conditions and the avoidance of all forms of discrimination

Every employee is required to observe these rules and to immediately report any violation of the Corporate Compliance Policy. This general reporting requirement does not apply in France due to peculiarities
of national law. Managerial employees have a vital role to play in implementing the Corporate Compliance Policy in the Bayer Group. As role models, they help to ensure this essential code of conduct is
actively adhered to. Managers may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be
subject to further disciplinary measures if systematic violations of applicable law have occurred in their
sphere of responsibility. Compliant and lawful conduct factors into the performance evaluations of all
managerial employees.
Adherence to the Corporate Compliance Policy is among the subjects covered in all audits conducted by
Bayer‚Äôs Internal Audit. Audits are planned using a function- and risk-based approach that also takes a
corruption awareness index into consideration. Audits of the major companies, which together account
for about 90% of Group sales, are planned to take place every three years. A total of 214 audits were
conducted in 2015. These included 38 preventive or incident-related compliance audits. The head of
Internal Audit regularly attends the meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, presenting a list of conducted audits and their outcomes at least once a year.
COMPLIANCE ORGANIZATION
The Bayer Group‚Äôs compliance organization is headed by the Group Compliance Officer, who regularly
reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. A central compliance department supports the Group Compliance Officer in steering and
implementing the Group-wide compliance activities. In 2015 each subgroup and service company had
its own compliance officer, whose responsibilities included ensuring adherence to subgroup- or industry-specific standards. A central compliance officer ‚Äì supported where necessary by further compliance
functions ‚Äì is available in every country or country group to answer questions from all employees regarding lawful and ethical behavior in business-related situations.
The compliance organization operates in accordance with international standards such as the oecd
Recommendations of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.

190

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

The mission and the goals of the Bayer Group‚Äôs compliance organization are set forth in our Compliance
Charter, which forms the basis for proactive, risk-based, collaborative cooperation with the operational
business aimed at early prevention of compliance violations. For compliance to continue developing as a
permanent, active part of Bayer‚Äôs corporate culture, it must be integrated into all operational business
units and their work processes.
A Group-wide compliance management system serves the purpose of early prevention. This system is
based on partnership with the operational business and features dialogue, transparency and continuous
improvement. It also includes the punishment of compliance violations.
The preventive approach is driven by the Integrated Compliance Management (icm) project. This promotes close, systematic cooperation between compliance experts and operational business managers.
With the help of icm, relevant business risks can be identified and minimized. A systematic process is in
place involving roundtable meetings to discuss identified compliance risks and coordinate steps to
mitigate them. The participants in these roundtables are the compliance functions and the operational
business managers. The results of the roundtables are entered and tracked in a Group-wide compliance
risk management database.
Group target 2015:
conducting preventive
risk assessments in all
three subgroups
See also Chapter
1.4 for Group
targets

In line with our Group target, we had carried out comprehensive, preemptive risk assessments in the
holding company, all three subgroups and the country organizations by the end of 2015. The project
also includes regular self-monitoring by the operational business units based on appropriate auditing
and inspection procedures. icm is focused on the areas of antitrust law, anticorruption measures, export
control, conflicts of interest, insider trading, antidiscrimination and privacy. At the beginning of 2016,
the project was transferred to the company‚Äôs compliance and privacy organization.
Compliance violations can be reported ‚Äì anonymously if desired ‚Äì via a central, global compliance hotline, which was switched in 2015 to a new international provider offering additional services. In 2015
the compliance organization received a total of 185 reports via this compliance hotline (121 of these
anonymous), which is also accessible to the general public. Of these reports, 10 came from Germany
and 175 from other countries. As an alternative to the compliance hotline, suspected compliance violations may also be reported to the compliance officer for the respective country organization or to Internal Audit.
All suspected compliance violations in the Group are recorded according to uniform criteria and dealt
with under the rules set forth in Bayer‚Äôs Directive on the Management of Compliance Incidents.
online annex: 3-16.3-1
Where an investigation confirms that a compliance violation has occurred, the company has a graduated set of measures at its disposal. These include a verbal or written warning, transfer to a different
unit, cancellation of a planned promotion, a reduction in the short-term incentive payment, downgrading to a lower collectively agreed pay rate or managerial contract level, and ordinary or extraordinary termination. This does not preclude the company from asserting further claims against the

The action taken in each case depends on the gravity of the compliance violation and on applicable
law.

COMPLIANCE TRAINING AND COMMUNICATIONS
Group-wide training programs tailored to requirements and target groups, along with extensive communications activities, help to further raise the employees‚Äô awareness for compliance issues and the
risks involved. In 2015, 38,609 Bayer managers, or 96.6% of the global total, took a compliance training
program. This was in line with the Group target.
online annex: 3-16.3-2
The aim of these targeted training programs is to ensure that employees do not overstep boundaries
out of ignorance or uncertainty. Our compliance training programs reflect the focus areas of the icm
project and are available in various formats to meet the needs of different employee groups. Some
take the form of web-based training (wbt) programs, while others involve face-to-face training sessions or workshops.

Group target 2015:
annual compliance
training for all Bayer
managers (> 99%)

See also Chapter
1.4 for Group
targets

In 2015, we implemented a new global web-based training program in 83 countries on the subject of
conflicts of interest. This program, initially available in 10 languages, has already been completed by
26,163 employees.
New hires and employees switching to different areas of responsibility within Bayer are regularly invited to participate in the training programs relevant to their functions. This ensures that all new employees receive the appropriate compliance training.
In view of the particularly strict compliance rules in the area of health care, we offer special training
programs for the employees working in this field. Further details are given in Chapter 7 ‚ÄúProcurement, Products, Logistics, Distribution.‚Äù
We again ran a broad-based communications campaign in 2015 to provide comprehensive information to all employees about compliance and the availability of advice from compliance staff under
the new partnering concept, as well as to enhance their awareness for compliance-critical situations.
The communications activities in 2015 focused on conflicts of interest and product-related communications. A wide range of internal media offerings was available on both topics. At the start of the
year, a quiz provided the opportunity for employees to refresh their knowledge of various aspects of
compliance.

16.4 Compensation Report
The Compensation Report describes the essential features of the compensation system for the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and explains the compensation of the
individual members. The report conforms to the requirements of the German Commercial Code including the principles of German Accounting Standard No. 17 (drs 17). It also complies with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (ifrs).

16.4.1 Compensation of the Board of Management
OBJECTIVES
The structure of the compensation system for the Board of Management of Bayer AG is aimed at ensuring performance-oriented corporate governance and a long-term increase in the company‚Äôs value.
The core elements of the system include fixed compensation, which takes into account the tasks and
duties of the Board of Management members, and an incentivized component ‚Äì the short-term incentive (sti) ‚Äì, which depends on the attainment of the annual corporate performance targets. In addition
to the compensation directly related to each year of service, there are two long-term stock-based components that are directly related to the development of Bayer‚Äôs share price over time and thus are
intended to create an incentive for a sustained commitment to the company. The system is also designed to enable the company to successfully compete for highly qualified executives and to ensure
statutory and regulatory compliance. Board of Management compensation is in line with the basic
principles of the compensation structure for managerial employees in the Bayer Group. The appropriateness of the system and the compensation level are regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board,
which then makes any necessary adjustments.
COMPENSATION STRUCTURE UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2015
The compensation paid to the members of the Board of Management includes both non-performancerelated and performance-related components. The compensation structure, based on average total
annual compensation and 100% target attainment, is as follows:

Excluding fringe benefits and pension entitlements

The non-performance-related compensation comprises the fixed annual compensation along with fringe
benefits. The performance-related compensation partly comprises a variable component (sti), of which
50% takes the form of short-term variable cash compensation and 50% consists of long-term cash
compensation involving a grant of virtual Bayer shares that are retained for three years. The other performance-related compensation component serving as a long-term incentive is the stock-based cash
compensation program Aspire, where a four-year retention period applies.

193

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

The individual performance-related components are capped at the grant date. The cap on the total compensation is 1.8 times the respective target compensation and is determined annually when the fixed
compensation is set.
The members of the Board of Management also receive pension entitlements for themselves and their
surviving dependents.
Non-performance-related components
Fixed annual compensation
The level of the non-performance-related, fixed annual compensation takes into account the functions
and responsibilities assigned to the members of the Board of Management as well as market conditions.
The fixed compensation is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board in light of the consumer price
index and adjusted if necessary. It is paid out in twelve monthly installments.
Fringe benefits
This component mainly includes perquisites such as a company car with driver or the use of the company carpool, payments toward the cost of security equipment, and the reimbursement of the cost of
annual health screening examinations. Fringe benefits are reported at cost or the amount of the pecuniary advantage gained.
Performance-related components
Short-term variable cash compensation
The short-term variable compensation (short-term incentive, or sti) is based on a set percentage of the
fixed annual compensation (target value). This amount is adjusted according to the target attainments of
the Bayer Group, the subgroups and the individual Board of Management member.
The Group component is determined in relation to core earnings per share of the Group, while the subgroup components are governed by the weighted average target attainments of the HealthCare, CropScience and Covestro subgroups. The annual subgroup targets are derived from the respective business
strategies and operational priorities. The target attainment for HealthCare and CropScience is mainly
based on the comparison of target and actual values for the ebitda margin before special items and
sales growth. At Covestro it is measured in terms of the cash flow return on investment (cfroi). Target
attainment also takes into account qualitative objectives including safety, compliance and sustainability
aspects.
The target attainment for the individual component of the variable compensation is determined by the
Supervisory Board. One half of the sti for each year is paid out in the second quarter of the following
year, while the other half is granted in the form of virtual Bayer shares.

Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares
Both the number of virtual shares granted and the amount of the payment at the end of the retention
period are based on the average official closing prices of Bayer shares over the last 30 trading days of the
respective year in the Xetra system of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. A cash payment with respect to the
number of virtual shares held is made at the end of the three-year period according to the market price of
Bayer shares at that time. In addition, the members of the Board of Management receive an amount
equal to the total dividends paid on the equivalent number of real shares during the period. Payment is
made in January of the year following the end of the three-year retention period. This payment is capped
at 200% of the amount converted into virtual shares at the beginning of the three-year period. No option
exists for the Board of Management members to extend the retention period or defer the payout. When a
member leaves the Board of Management, the retention period for two-thirds of each tranche is shortened to two years. If the member leaves during a fiscal year, payment is made immediately with respect
to two-thirds of any tranche that has already been retained for more than two years. The remaining onethird of each tranche continues to be subject to the three-year retention period.
Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire I)
Members of the Board of Management are eligible to participate in the annual tranches of the long-term
stock-based compensation program Aspire i ("Aspire") on condition that they purchase a certain number of Bayer shares ‚Äì determined for each individual according to specific guidelines ‚Äì as a personal
investment and for as long as they continue in the service of the Bayer Group. The payments made
under this program are based on the Aspire Target Opportunity, which is a contractually agreed percentage of fixed annual compensation. Depending on the performance of Bayer stock, both in absolute
terms and relative to the euro stoxx 50 benchmark index, participants are granted an award of between 0% and 300% of their individual Aspire Target Opportunity at the end of the performance period. The payout / performance matrix according to the absolute and relative development of Bayer‚Äôs
share price is explained at http://www.investor.bayer.com/en/stock/stock-programs/aspire/.

Performance period

When a member of the Board of Management retires, current tranches may be shortened, thus reducing
their value. In this case, tranches up to the one issued in 2011 were shortened on a pro-rated basis
according to the duration of the member‚Äôs active service on the Board of Management during the period
of the tranche; tranches issued in 2012 or later are shortened according to the duration of the member‚Äôs
active service on the Board of Management during the first year of the tranche.
Expanded Share Ownership Guidelines
On top of the requirement for participants in the Aspire program to make a personal investment in
Bayer shares, the members of the Board of Management have undertaken to comply with expanded
Share Ownership Guidelines. These require the Chairman of the Board of Management to build a position in Bayer shares to the value of 150% of his fixed annual compensation, and the other members to
the value of 100% of their fixed annual salaries, within four years and to continue to hold them for as
long as they remain Board of Management members. Half the number of virtual shares granted to them
through conversion of 50% of the sti into virtual shares counts toward this position. The Board of Management members must provide documentary evidence of their compliance with this obligation for the
first time at the end of the four-year position-building period and again yearly thereafter. In the event of
significant changes in fixed annual compensation, the value to which shares must be held is adjusted
accordingly.
Pension entitlements (retirement and surviving dependents‚Äô pensions)
The members of the Board of Management appointed prior to 2013 are generally entitled to receive a
lifelong company pension after leaving the Bayer Group, though not before the age of 60. This pension
is normally paid out in the form of a monthly life annuity. Dr. Marijn Dekkers has the option to receive a
capital sum in place of an annuity.
The annual pension granted equals at least 15% of final fixed annual compensation. This percentage
can increase with continuing service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%. The arrangements for surviving dependents basically provide for a widow‚Äôs pension amounting to 60% of the
member‚Äôs pension entitlement and an orphan‚Äôs pension amounting to 15% of the member‚Äôs pension
entitlement for each child up to an age that has been contractually agreed or set out under insurance
conditions.
Future pension payments are annually reviewed and adjusted based on the development of consumer
prices. Pension rights are suspended if a member of the Board of Management works for a competitor
of Bayer AG or of another Group company before the age of 65 without the prior written consent of the
Supervisory Board.
The annual pension entitlement for members of the Board of Management appointed in 2013 or thereafter is based on contributions. Bayer provides a hypothetical contribution amounting to 33% of the
respective fixed compensation each year. This percentage is comprised of a 6% basic contribution and
a 27% matching contribution ‚Äì three times the member‚Äôs personal contribution of 9%. The total annual
contribution is converted into a pension module according to the annuity table for the applicable tariff

196

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG pension fund. The annual pension entitlement upon retirement
(at 62 years of age at the earliest) is the total amount of the accumulated pension modules including an
investment bonus. The investment bonus is determined annually based on the net return on the assets
of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG minus the minimum return on the contributions that is guaranteed under the tariff and approved by the German Financial Supervisory Authority. Kemal Malik has
been granted, in addition, a vested entitlement to a fixed annual pension of ‚Ç¨80 thousand starting on his
65th birthday. This is subject to a pro-rated reduction in the event that his term of office ends prior to
his 65th birthday under certain conditions.
The ultimate pension entitlement cannot be precisely determined in advance. It depends on the development of the member‚Äôs compensation, the number of years of service on the Board of Management
and the return on the assets of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG. We currently estimate the achievable total pension entitlement at approximately 45% of a member‚Äôs annual fixed compensation immediately prior to retirement, with roughly 38% financed by the company and 7% by the member of the
Board of Management.
Certain assets are administered by Bayer Pension Trust e.V. under a contractual trust arrangement (cta),
providing substantial additional security for pension obligations resulting from direct commitments for
members of the Board of Management in Germany.
Benefits upon termination of service on the Board of Management
Post-contractual noncompete agreements
Post-contractual noncompete agreements exist with the members of the Board of Management, providing for compensatory payments to be made by the company for the two-year duration of these agreements. The compensatory payment amounts to 100% of the average fixed compensation for the twelve
months preceding their departure. The post-contractual noncompete agreement with Dr. Marijn Dekkers was rescinded without compensation when his service contract was extended in June 2014 in line
with previous practice in a similar case.
Change of control
Agreements exist with the members of the Board of Management providing for severance indemnity in
certain circumstances in the event of a change in control. The amount of any possible severance indemnity in the case of early termination of service on the Board of Management as a result of a change in
control is limited to the value of three years‚Äô compensation in line with the recommendation in Section
4.2.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Such payments do not exceed the compensation
payable for the remaining term of the service contract.
Unfitness for work
In the event of temporary unfitness for work, members of the Board of Management continue to receive
the contractually agreed compensation. Bayer AG may early terminate the service contract if the member has been continuously unfit for work for at least 18 months and is likely to be permanently incapable of fully performing his duties (permanent incapacity to work). A disability pension is paid in the
event of contract termination before the age of 60 due to permanent incapacity to work. For the members appointed to the Board of Management prior to 2013, the disability pension, like the retirement
pension, amounts to at least 15% of the final fixed compensation and can increase with continuing
service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%. For members of the Board of Management appointed in 2013 or thereafter, the amount of the disability pension under the service contract
corresponds to the entitlement accrued on the date of contract termination, taking into account a fictitious period of service between that date and the member‚Äôs 55th birthday, where applicable.

Short-term variable cash compensation
The total short-term variable cash compensation (short-term portion of the sti) for all the members of
the Board of Management in 2015 totaled ‚Ç¨5,983 thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨5,051 thousand) after deduction of
the solidarity contribution. Provisions of ‚Ç¨5,983 thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨4,771 thousand) were established for
payment of this compensation component to the members of the Board of Management serving as of
December 31, 2015. The solidarity contribution is made by all employees of the companies covered by
the respective agreements with the employee representatives to help safeguard jobs at the German
sites. For 2015 it amounted to 0.20% (2014: 0.27%) of each member‚Äôs total sti award.
Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares
The conversion of 50% of the sti for 2015 into virtual Bayer shares was based on an average price of
‚Ç¨119.17 (2014: ‚Ç¨115.66).
The long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares that is included in the aggregate compensation according to the German Commercial Code was valued at ‚Ç¨5,983 thousand (2014:
‚Ç¨5,058 thousand). The aggregate compensation according to the ifrs also includes a change of ‚Ç¨556
thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨1,559 thousand) in the value of existing entitlements.
Provisions of ‚Ç¨18,663 thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨17,775 thousand) existed as of December 31, 2015, for the
future cash disbursements to currently serving members of the Board of Management based on the
virtual Bayer shares granted in the respective year. This amount also contains the dividend attributable
to the respective prior year.
Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire)
The long-term stock-based cash compensation under the Aspire program is included in the aggregate
compensation according to the German Commercial Code at its fair value of ‚Ç¨1,290 thousand (2014:
‚Ç¨978 thousand) at the respective grant date.
According to the ifrs, the aggregate compensation includes the fair value of the partial entitlement
earned in the respective year. Grants of stock-based compensation with a four-year performance period
are therefore expensed at their respective fair values over four years starting with the grant year. The
aggregate compensation according to the ifrs also includes the change in the value of existing entitlements under ongoing Aspire tranches granted in prior years as stock-based compensation according to
the ifrs.

Including company contribution to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG or Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG
Prof. Dr. Plischke stepped down from the Board of Management as of midnight on April 29, 2014.

The difference between the pension service cost according to the German Commercial Code and the
service cost for pension entitlements according to the ifrs arises from the difference in the valuation
principles used in calculating the settlement value according to the German Commercial Code and the
present value of the defined benefit pension obligation according to the ifrs.
Benefits upon termination of service on the Board of Management
It was agreed with Michael K√∂nig that he be granted benefits of ‚Ç¨1,131 thousand in connection with the
mutually agreed early termination effective December 31, 2015, of his service contract, which originally
ran until March 31, 2016. These benefits comprised fixed compensation, short-term variable compensation components (sti), Aspire and pension contributions ‚Äì each for the period January 1 to March 31,
2016 ‚Äì, along with the fair value of the accelerated vested portions of the existing Aspire tranches. The
fixed compensation and short-term variable compensation component, together amounting to ‚Ç¨375 thousand, will be paid during the first half of 2016. The payments from the Aspire tranches will be made upon
expiration of each tranche based on the respective Aspire program parameters. In addition, a two-year
non-compete agreement ending on December 31, 2017, exists with Michael K√∂nig under his service
contract. The resulting compensatory payment of ‚Ç¨725 thousand per year will be made to him in monthly
installments.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016
The structure of the compensation package for the Board of Management of Bayer AG and the compensation level are intended to be sustainable, performance-based and appropriate. To ensure this, the
Supervisory Board regularly reviews the compensation system and adjusts it as necessary. The most
recent comprehensive review of the system, which the Supervisory Board performed in the third quarter
of 2015, revealed a need for adjustments, mainly in view of the new divisional structure and the increase
in the number of members of the Board of Management from five to eight. The review also showed that
adjustments were necessary in light of the target positioning in relation to the other dax companies.
The review and the new compensation structure are based on an expert report from an independent
compensation consultant.

201

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
16. Corporate Governance Report

The target percentages for the short- and long-term variable compensation are in the future the same
for all the members of the Board of Management. The new structure featuring 100% fixed compensation, 100% target amount for the short-term variable compensation and 150% for the long-term variable compensation is intended to provide even greater encouragement for performance-oriented governance geared to long-term success.
In the future, the short-term variable compensation of the Board of Management will still be based on
the attainment of targets set for three sub-components ‚Äì a Group component, a segment component
and an individual performance component ‚Äì each of which will be given a weighting of one-third when
evaluating the performance of each member of the Board. The Group component, which is based on the
core earnings per share of the Group (including Covestro), and the individual performance subcomponents based on the responsibilities of each member of the Board are basically unchanged. The
segment component will be incentivized based on the average performance of the operating segments,
with Pharmaceuticals having a 50% weighting, Consumer Health 20% and Crop Science (including
Animal Health) 30%. In the case of the Board members responsible for an operating segment, however,
this one-third is incentivized based on the profitability of the respective business only. In light of the
legal and economic independence of Covestro and its stock market flotation in October 2015, it is no
longer included in the evaluation of the segment-based component.
In addition, a new stock-based cash compensation program is being introduced from 2016. In the future
the target amounts ‚Äì expressed in numbers of virtual shares ‚Äì will be derived from the contractually
agreed target percentage and the individual sti payment factors of the Board members in the year prior
to the issuance of the respective tranche. The cash payment amounts will be determined after four years
based on the share price then applicable, the performance of the Bayer share relative to the EuroStoxx
50 and the dividends paid in the meantime. The cap on the payments to be made under this long-term
compensation program newly introduced from 2016 is 250%, compared to 300% under the predecessor program. Thus the new compensation system maintains consistency between the Board of Management and other management levels. In the case of the Board of Management, however, an additional
payment hurdle related to the EuroStoxx 50 has been introduced for the lti plan.
To reduce complexity and enhance transparency, the long-term variable cash compensation component
based on the conversion of part of the sti into virtual Bayer shares is now discontinued and the Share
Ownership Guidelines have been simplified. Caps continue to apply to each variable cash compensation
component and to the maximum total cash compensation for a given year in line with the recommendation in the German Corporate Governance Code.
The contribution-based pension has been adjusted in line with market conditions. Until now, Bayer has
provided to the members of the Board of Management appointed in 2013 or thereafter a hypothetical
contribution amounting to 33% of the respective fixed compensation each year. This hypothetical contribution has now been increased to 42% of the respective fixed compensation, and, as in the past, is
converted into a pension module according to the annuity table for the applicable tariff of the
Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG pension fund.

16.4.3 Compensation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is compensated according to the relevant provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation.
The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation of ‚Ç¨120,000 plus reimbursement of their expenses.
In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, additional compensation is paid to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for chairing and
membership of committees. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed annual compensation of ‚Ç¨360,000, the Vice Chairman ‚Ç¨240,000. These amounts also cover membership and chairmanship of committees. The other members receive additional compensation for committee membership.
The chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional ‚Ç¨120,000, the other members of the Audit
Committee ‚Ç¨60,000 each. The chairmen of the remaining committees receive ‚Ç¨60,000 each, the other
members of those committees ‚Ç¨30,000 each. No additional compensation is paid for membership of the
Nominations Committee. A Supervisory Board member who is a member of more than two committees
receives compensation only for the two committees with the highest compensation. If changes are made
to the Supervisory Board and / or its committees during the year, members receive compensation on a
pro-rated basis. The members of the Supervisory Board also receive an attendance fee of ‚Ç¨1,000 each
time they personally attend a meeting of the Supervisory Board or a committee. The attendance fee is
limited to ‚Ç¨1,000 per day.
The members of the Supervisory Board have given a voluntary pledge that they will each purchase
Bayer shares for 25% of their pre-tax fixed compensation, including any additional compensation for
committee membership, and hold these shares for as long as they remain members of the Supervisory
Board. This does not apply to members who are prevented from purchasing shares due to a service or
employment contract with a company or who transfer at least 85% of their fixed compensation to the
Hans B√∂ckler Foundation in accordance with the rules of the German Trade Union Confederation or
whose service or employment contract with a company requires them to transfer such compensation to
that company. If less than 85% of the fixed compensation is transferred, the voluntary pledge applies to
the portion not transferred. By voluntarily pledging to invest in and hold Bayer shares, the Supervisory
Board members reinforce their interest in the long-term, sustainable success of the company.

In addition to their compensation as members of the Supervisory Board, those employee representatives who are employees of Bayer Group companies receive compensation unrelated to their service on
the Supervisory Board. The total amount of such compensation in 2015 was ‚Ç¨741 thousand (2014:
‚Ç¨737 thousand).
No compensation was paid or benefits granted to members of the Supervisory Board for personally
performed services such as consultancy or agency services. The company has purchased insurance for
the members of the Supervisory Board to cover their personal liability arising from their service on the
Supervisory Board.

16.4.4 Further Information
ADVANCES OR LOANS TO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
OR SUPERVISORY BOARD
There were no advances or loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board
outstanding as of December 31, 2015, nor at any time during 2015 or 2014.
PENSION PAYMENTS TO FORMER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
OR THEIR SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
We currently pay retired members of the Board of Management a monthly pension equal to a maximum
of 80% of the fixed compensation received immediately prior to retirement. The pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management or their surviving dependents are reassessed annually and
adjusted, taking into account the development of consumer prices. The pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management or their surviving dependents in 2015 totaled ‚Ç¨13,416 thousand
(2014: ‚Ç¨13,457 thousand). These benefits are paid in addition to any amounts they receive under previous employee pension arrangements. The present value of the defined benefit pension obligation for
former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents according to the ifrs
amounted to ‚Ç¨172,767 thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨187,759 thousand), while the settlement value of the pension
obligation according to the German Commercial Code amounted to ‚Ç¨148,632 thousand (2014: ‚Ç¨146,341
thousand).

As of February 2016

We anticipate somewhat accelerated growth for the global economy in 2016 compared with the previous year. Although further interest rate hikes by the u.s. Federal Reserve are expected following the first
upward step in December 2015, interest rates will likely remain low overall worldwide, thus continuing
to help stimulate the economy. A supporting effect will come from the low oil price, which will provide
relief to consumers and strengthen private demand.
Impetus is expected above all from the United States, where employment and consumption will probably further increase. In Europe, too, we anticipate an ongoing recovery. While the pace of economic
growth continues to be held back by high unemployment, particularly in a number of southern European countries, growth in Germany will presumably pick up further. In this connection, the eurozone
countries will benefit especially from the favorable euro exchange rate.
In the Emerging Markets as well, we expect rising growth rates again overall following a relatively weak
prior year. By contrast, we foresee a further slowdown in growth in China. Economic output in Russia
and Brazil will likely decline in 2016, albeit less severely than in the previous year.

estimate, except pharmaceuticals. Source for pharmaceuticals market: IMS Health. IMS Market Prognosis. Copyright 2015.
All rights reserved; currency-adjusted; 2015 data provisional
As of February 2016

We expect growth in the pharmaceuticals market to be slower in 2016 than in the previous year. In
Europe we anticipate low-single-digit percentage growth that is below the prior-year level. The pace of
growth is likely to slacken in the Emerging Markets, while the Japanese pharmaceuticals market will
probably stagnate. We are expecting positive momentum from the United States, where persistent
growth, supported above all by new product launches, is forecasted.
We anticipate that the consumer health market will grow somewhat more slowly in 2016 than in the
previous year. We expect the cold season to be weaker than in 2015 and anticipate that fewer products
will be reclassified as nonprescription products, particularly in the United States. Due to the economic
development in Brazil, Russia and China, we are assuming a lower pace of growth in these countries
than in the previous year.
Following a weak prior year, we predict that the global seed and crop protection market will stagnate
overall in 2016 due to high inventories and low prices for agricultural commodities. As in the previous
year, we expect positive growth impulses to come from Europe and the Asia / Pacific region. For Asia we
anticipate a further expansion of agricultural production. By contrast, we predict a tight market situation
in both North and South America, with growth slower than global development.
Following growth impetus in the animal health market over the past two years as a result of successful
product launches, especially in the companion animals segment, we expect a slightly slower pace of
growth for the market overall in 2016.
Covestro foresees an improved economic climate in 2016 for its main customer industries (automotive, construction, electrical and electronics, and furniture). The company believes that growth impetus
in North America will come from an increase in private consumption and an increase in public spending. For the European Union Covestro anticipates a continuation of the economic recovery in view of the
ongoing expansionary monetary policy and the weak euro. China will once again grow more slowly
overall due to industrial overcapacities and a high debt level, while positive growth signals will come
from India and Japan.

Our forecast for fiscal 2016 is based on the exchanges rates at the closing date on December 31, 2015,
including rates of us$1.09 to the euro. A 1% appreciation (depreciation) of the euro against all other
currencies would decrease (increase) sales on an annual basis by some ‚Ç¨300 million and ebitda before
special items by about ‚Ç¨90 million.
BAYER GROUP
In 2016, we are planning sales of more than ‚Ç¨47 billion for the Bayer Group, including Covestro. This
corresponds to a low-single-digit percentage increase on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. We
plan to increase ebitda before special items by a mid-single-digit percentage. We aim to increase core
earnings per share from continuing operations (calculated as explained in Chapter 14.3 ‚ÄúCore Earnings
Per Share‚Äù) by a mid-single-digit percentage as well. It should be borne in mind that only 69% of
Covestro will be reflected for the full year 2016. From the sale of the Diabetes Care business, we expect
core earnings per share of just under ‚Ç¨0.40 for discontinued operations.

212

Bayer Annual Report 2015

18. Future Perspectives

LIFE SCIENCES TOTAL
We plan sales of approximately ‚Ç¨35 billion for the Life Science activities, i.e. the Bayer Group excluding
Covestro. This corresponds to a mid-single-digit percentage increase on a currency- and portfolioadjusted basis. We plan to increase ebitda before special items by a mid-single-digit percentage. Our
planning includes dissynergies of around ‚Ç¨130 million from the legal independence of Covestro and
from divestments.
PHARMACEUTICALS
Despite declining price developments in some areas, we expect sales of approximately ‚Ç¨16 billion at
Pharmaceuticals ‚Äì including the Radiology business. This corresponds to a mid-single-digit percentage
increase on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. We plan to raise sales of our recently launched
products to more than ‚Ç¨5 billion. We expect a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in ebitda
before special items. Also, we aim to improve the ebitda margin before special items.
CONSUMER HEALTH
In the Consumer Health Division, we expect sales to come in at more than ‚Ç¨6 billion. We plan to grow
sales by a mid-single-digit percentage on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. We aim to improve
ebitda before special items by a mid-single-digit percentage.
CROP SCIENCE
At Crop Science we expect sales to be at the prior-year level. This corresponds to a low-single-digit
percentage increase on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. We plan to increase ebitda before
special items by a low-single-digit percentage.
ANIMAL HEALTH
At Animal Health we expect sales slightly above the prior-year level. We plan a currency- and portfolioadjusted sales gain and an increase in ebitda before special items, each by a low- to mid-single-digit
percentage.
RECONCILIATION
For 2016, we expect sales to be level with the previous year. We are planning ebitda before special
items of roughly minus ‚Ç¨0.2 billion.
COVESTRO
For 2016, Covestro is budgeting sales at the prior-year level and a decline in ebitda after adjustment for
special items.
FURTHER INFORMATION AND BAYER GROUP KEY DATA
We expect to take special charges in the region of ‚Ç¨0.5 billion in 2016, with the integration of the acquired consumer care businesses and charges in connection with the reorganization of the Bayer Group
accounting for most of this amount.

We predict the financial result to come in at around minus ‚Ç¨1.2 billion. The effective tax rate is likely to
be about 24%. We expect net financial debt to be below ‚Ç¨16 billion at the end of 2016.
BAYER AG
As the parent company of the Bayer Group, Bayer AG derives most of its income from its subsidiaries.
The earnings of the major subsidiaries in Germany are transferred directly to Bayer AG under profit and
loss transfer agreements. The earnings of Bayer AG are therefore expected to reflect the positive business development anticipated in the Bayer Group. A concerted dividend policy within the Group ensures
the availability of sufficient distributable income. Based on these factors, we expect Bayer AG to report
a distributable profit that will again enable our stockholders to adequately participate in the Bayer
Group‚Äôs earnings.

Process-independent monitoring

The entrepreneurial decisions we make daily in the course of business processes are based on balancing opportunities and risks. We therefore regard opportunity and risk management as an integral aspect
of business management rather than the task of a specific organizational unit. Our opportunity and risk
management is rooted in our strategy and planning processes. Based on these, we determine relevant
external and internal opportunities along with economic, ecological and social challenges. Opportunities and risks are identified by observing and analyzing trends along with macroeconomic, industryspecific, regional and local developments. These opportunities and risks are then evaluated and incorporated into business-specific strategic and operational frameworks. We attempt to avoid or mitigate
risks by taking appropriate countermeasures, or to transfer them to third parties (such as insurers) to
the extent possible and economically acceptable. We consciously accept and bear manageable and
controllable risks that stand in a reasonable relation to the anticipated opportunities. They are an aspect

215

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

of general entrepreneurial risk. Opportunities and risks are continuously monitored so that changes in
the economic or legal environment, for example, can be identified at an early stage and suitable countermeasures can be initiated if necessary.
To enable the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to monitor material business risks as
legally required, the following systems are in place: an internal control system ensuring proper and
effective financial reporting pursuant to Section 289, Paragraph 5 and Section 315, Paragraph 2, No. 5
of the German Commercial Code; a compliance management system; and a risk early warning system
pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.
The various management systems are based on different risk types, risk levels and timelines. Different
processes, methods and it systems are therefore applied to identify, evaluate, manage, and monitor
risks. The principles underlying the various systems are documented in Group directives that are contained in our Management Regulations (Margo) database and are accessible to all employees via the
Bayer intranet. System owners and coordinators are named at the management level in the divisions,
service companies, country companies and central functions of the Bayer Group. The overall responsibility for the effectiveness and appropriateness of the systems lies with the Chief Financial Officer.
The different systems are described below.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR (GROUP) ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
(Report pursuant to Sections 289, Paragraph 5 and 315, Paragraph 2, No. 5 of the German Commercial
Code)
Bayer has an internal control system (ics) in place for the (Group) accounting and financial reporting
process. This process comprises defined structures and workflows implemented throughout the organization. The purpose of our ics is to ensure proper and effective accounting and financial reporting in
accordance with Section 289, Paragraph 5 and Section 315, Paragraph 2, No. 5 of the German Commercial Code.
The ics is designed to guarantee timely, uniform and accurate accounting for all business processes and
transactions based on applicable statutory regulations, accounting and financial reporting standards and
the internal Group directives that are binding upon all consolidated companies.
The ics is based on the coso i (Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and cobit (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) frameworks and addresses
misreporting risks in the consolidated financial statements. Risks are identified and evaluated, and steps
are taken to counter them. Mandatory ics standards such as system-based and manual reconciliation
processes and functional separation have been derived from these frameworks and promulgated
throughout the Group by the Accounting unit of Bayer AG.
The management of each Group company holds responsibility for implementing the ics standards at the
local level. Using Bayer‚Äôs shared service centers, the Group companies prepare their financial statements locally and transmit them with the aid of a standard Group data model that is based on the Group
accounting directive. This ensures the regulatory compliance of the consolidated financial statements.

216

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

The effectiveness of the ics processes for accounting and financial reporting is evaluated on the basis of
a cascaded self-assessment system that starts with the persons directly involved in the processes, then
involves the principal responsible managers and ends with the Board of Management. The system also
makes use of internal and external audits. An it application in use throughout the Bayer Group ensures
uniform and audit-proof documentation and transparent presentation of all ics-relevant business processes, focusing especially on the relevant risks, controls and effectiveness evaluations.
The Board of Management has confirmed the effective functioning of the internal control system for
accounting and financial reporting and the relevant criteria for the 2015 fiscal year. However, it should
be noted that an internal control system, irrespective of its design, cannot provide absolute assurance
that material misstatements in the accounting will be avoided or identified.
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our compliance management system is aimed at ensuring lawful, responsible and sustainable conduct
by our employees. It is designed to identify potential violations in advance and systematically prevent
their occurrence. The compliance management system thus contributes significantly to the integration
of compliance into our operating units and their processes.
In light of the Bayer Group‚Äôs diversified structure and international focus, we are active in different
industry sectors, markets and geographical regions worldwide, each of which has its own local legislation and industry codes. Compliance risks are identified by performing a trend analysis based on cases
reported from around the world. We embarked on the global implementation of an integrated compliance management system in 2014. This system enhances the systematic and preventive identification
and assessment of risks. Risk identification is carried out both from the bottom up via the country organizations and from the top down via the global functions, taking global, local and business-specific
aspects into account. In addition, compliance program audits are performed by Internal Audit. These
audits proactively evaluate the implementation of the Corporate Compliance Policy in the country organizations. All the results are discussed by the local business units, the local compliance officers and representatives of the headquarters functions at a round table and are entered into a risk database.
RISK EARLY WARNING SYSTEM PURSUANT TO SECTION 91, PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE
GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT
A process known as BayRisk has been established to enable the early identification of any adverse developments that are material and / or could endanger the company‚Äôs continued existence, thus satisfying
the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for corporate risks pursuant to Section 91,
Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. This process is steered by a central unit within the
Corporate Center to ensure the implementation of a consistent framework and standards for Bayer‚Äôs risk
early warning system.
The BayRisk process follows a bottom-up approach in order to identify corporate risks as fully as possible. The early identification, evaluation, management and reporting of risks is the responsibility of the
respective divisions, service companies and central functions. The process takes into account not only
risks that could directly impact our financial targets, but also those that could affect the achievement of
qualitative objectives such as the preservation of our reputation. Evaluation is based on both financial
and nonfinancial criteria. Risk coordinators are appointed to evaluate, manage and monitor the identified risks.

217

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

This results in a multidimensional evaluation which estimates the probability of occurrence, potential
damage and relevance for our external stakeholders. The following matrix illustrates the financial criteria for rating a risk as high, medium or low.

All risks that exceed defined and annually updated value thresholds, together with the respective countermeasures, are entered in a Group-wide database. The risk portfolio is reviewed three times a year.
Significant changes are documented and reported to the Board of Management. The risk portfolio is also
documented in a management information system and is thus accessible to the members of the Group
Leadership Circle at all times. A report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board once a year.
PROCESS-INDEPENDENT MONITORING
The effectiveness of our management systems is audited and evaluated at regular intervals by Internal
Audit, which performs an independent and objective audit function focused on verifying compliance
with laws and directives. Internal Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes
and helping to improve them. The selection of audit targets follows a risk- and cycle-based approach.
Internal Audit applies internationally recognized standards and performs reliable audit services. This is
confirmed by a quality assessment undertaken in 2012 by the American Institute of Internal Auditors
(iia). A report on the internal control system and its effectiveness is presented annually to the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Risks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection and product
quality are assessed through specific hseq (health, safety, environment and quality) audits.
In addition, the external auditor, as part of its audit of the annual financial statements, assesses the
basic suitability of the early warning system for identifying at an early stage any risks that could endanger the company‚Äôs continued existence. The auditor regularly reports to the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board on the identification of any weaknesses in the internal control system.
Audit outcomes are taken into account in the continuous enhancement of our management processes.

18.3.2 Opportunities and Risks
As a global enterprise with a diversified portfolio, the Bayer Group is constantly exposed to a wide
range of internal or external developments or events that could significantly impact the achievement of
our financial and nonfinancial objectives.
This chapter outlines the opportunities and risks which are classified in our risk matrix as ‚Äúmedium‚Äù or
‚Äúhigh.‚Äù Risks that occur in comparable forms in different parts of the company are described in general
terms. The sequence in which the risks are listed does not imply any order of significance. The opportunities and risks described apply to all divisions unless otherwise indicated. Also outlined in the following are risks that are of high relevance for the company but may be impossible to quantify directly,
accurately or in financial terms. The impact on the Bayer Group of risks attaching to the Covestro business is affected by the size of Bayer‚Äôs shareholding in that company.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Ethical conduct is a matter of essential importance for society. Many stakeholders evaluate companies
according to whether they conduct themselves not just ‚Äúlegally‚Äù but also ‚Äúlegitimately.‚Äù The Bayer
Group is dedicated to sustainable development in all areas of its commercial activity. This voluntary
commitment is reflected in our responsible corporate governance, which is geared toward generating
not only economic but also ecological and societal benefit.
In the Emerging Markets ‚Äì particularly Asia and Latin America ‚Äì we see growth opportunities, such as
those arising out of increasing affluence and the associated rise in demand for pharmaceutical products.
Bayer is therefore systematically expanding its business in these regions in particular.
At the same time, however, the risk exists that our growth could be impeded by increasing global cost
pressure on health systems. Pharmaceutical products are subject to regulatory price controls and regulations in many markets, and government reimbursement systems often favor less expensive generic
medicines over branded products. In addition, in some markets, major health care providers can exert
substantial pressure on prices. Price controls and pricing pressure reduce earnings from our pharmaceutical products and may occasionally make the market launch of a new product unprofitable. As a
result, it may be necessary to choose indirect marketing options in order to provide access to pharmaceuticals. We expect the current extent of regulatory controls and market pressures on pricing to persist
or increase. Changes in the business conditions in our key markets are continuously monitored. Depending on the intensity of such price controls and the pressure on prices, it could be necessary to
adjust our business model.
In some countries the marketing rights for certain pharmaceutical products are held by third parties. An
inadequate performance by collaboration partners could adversely affect the development of our sales
and costs. Therefore, we have established an Alliance Management unit to monitor the most important
collaborations and provide relevant support to the operational functions.
Further opportunities and risks may arise if actual market developments vary from those we predict in
Chapter 18.1 ‚ÄúEconomic Outlook.‚Äù Where macroeconomic developments deviate from forecasts, this
may either positively or negatively impact our sales and earnings expectations.
For Covestro, an economic downturn, changes in competitors‚Äô behavior or the market entry of new
competitors may lead to more intense competition and thus to overcapacities or increased pressure on
prices.

219

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

Continuous analysis of the economic environment and of economic forecasts enables us to pursue the
identified opportunities and to mitigate risks by adjusting our business strategy.
INNOVATION
We analyze global trends and develop innovative solutions to address them, thereby mastering the
challenges and taking advantage of the opportunities they provide.
Increase in life expectancy
Certain diseases, such as cancer or chronic cardiovascular disorders, are on the rise as a consequence
of higher life expectancy. In response to the growing demand for innovative health care products to
treat age-related diseases, Bayer‚Äôs Pharmaceuticals Division is focusing its r&d activities on relevant
therapeutic areas such as oncology and cardiology.
Shortage of arable land and increasing demand for food
The challenges associated with ensuring an adequate food supply worldwide continue to increase,
driven by global population growth, the reduction in available arable land and the consequences of
climate change. In addition, the anticipated increase in affluence in the emerging countries is boosting
the demand for animal-based food products. We expect there to be an increasing need for high-value
seed and crop protection products to allow sufficient food and animal feed to be produced to satisfy
rising demand despite limited acreages. The Crop Science Division is therefore developing processes to
more effectively protect plants against climate and environmental stresses and increase crop yields, for
example.
Conserving natural resources and protecting the climate
The finite nature of certain natural resources and efforts to protect the climate are boosting the demand
for innovative products and technologies that reduce resource consumption and lead to lower emissions. This trend is being reinforced by increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and growing
consumer awareness for the need to use resources sustainably. In this context, Covestro is developing
new materials that help to raise energy efficiency and reduce emissions. For example, polyurethane
from Covestro is used in the construction industry for thermal insulation, giving a positive energy balance, while the company‚Äôs polycarbonate is used in the automotive industry to reduce vehicle weight.
To enhance our innovation strength, we attach special importance to networking and cooperation both
within and outside of our company. One example is interdisciplinary research at the interface between
human, animal and plant health, which is being driven forward by our Life Sciences Fund. This enables
us to achieve research synergies and investigate new mechanisms of action that in the long term may
provide new impetus to product development. Our strategy also encompasses research projects with
outside partners from science and industry that give us access to complementary technologies and
external innovation potential.
For further information, see Chapter 4 ‚ÄúResearch, Development, Innovation‚Äù and Chapter 2 ‚ÄúStrategies
of the Divisions.‚Äù
Despite all our efforts, we cannot assure that all of the products we are currently developing or will
develop in the future will achieve planned approval / registration or commercial success. For example, a
drug candidate may fail to meet trial endpoints. The Bayer Group pursues a holistic portfolio management strategy in order to estimate the probability of success and prioritize its development projects.
Furthermore, the expectations of the public and the regulatory authorities with regard to the safety and
efficacy of chemical and pharmaceutical products are constantly rising. Against this background, we
continue to anticipate increasing regulatory requirements for clinical or (eco)toxicological studies, for
example. This increases product development costs and the time it takes to obtain registration or marketing approval. Special projects are set up to coordinate and ensure the successful implementation of
new regulations.

ACQUISITIONS
Where it appears strategically advantageous, we supplement our organic growth by acquiring companies or parts of companies. Failure to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or unexpectedly
high integration costs could jeopardize the achievement of qualitative or quantitative targets and adversely impact earnings. Teams of experts therefore manage both the due diligence process and the
subsequent integration of acquired companies. Due diligence includes reviewing risk-relevant factors
such as compliance with applicable environmental regulations and occupational health and safety
standards at production sites.
PATENT PROTECTION
Patents protect our intellectual property. When our products are successfully commercialized, some of
the profits can be used to continue investing in research and development. Due to the long period of
time between the patent application and the market launch of a product, Bayer generally only has a few
years in which to earn an adequate return on its investment in research and development. This makes
effective and reliable patent protection all the more important.
Most of our products, primarily in the Life Sciences, are covered by patents. Generic manufacturers, in
particular, attempt to contest patents prior to their expiration. Sometimes a generic version of a product
may even be launched ‚Äúat risk‚Äù prior to the issuance of a final patent decision. We are currently involved in legal proceedings to enforce patent protection for our products. Details of the risks arising
from these proceedings are given in note [32] to the consolidated financial statements. When a patent
defense is unsuccessful, or if one of our patents expires, our prices are likely to come under pressure
because of increased competition from generic products entering the market. Legal action by third
parties for alleged infringement of patent or proprietary rights by Bayer may impede or even halt the
development or manufacturing of certain products or require us to pay monetary damages or royalties
to third parties. Our patents department regularly reviews the patent situation in collaboration with the
respective operating units and monitors for potential patent infringements so that legal action can be
taken if necessary.
PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Bayer systematically and continuously evaluates the potential health and environmental risks of a product along the entire value chain ‚Äì from research and development, production, commercialization and
use by the customer to disposal.
Despite extensive studies prior to approval or registration, it is possible that products could be partially
or completely withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of unexpected side effects or other
factors. Such a withdrawal may be voluntary or result from legal or regulatory measures. Furthermore,
the presence of traces of unwanted genetically modified organisms in agricultural products and / or
foodstuffs cannot be entirely excluded. Potential payments of damages in connection with the above
risks may have a substantial negative impact on our earnings.
Our Life Science businesses counter these risks through a holistic organizational structure and process
organization in the areas of pharmaceutical and crop protection product safety and testing. In addition,
a comprehensive product stewardship program is in place in the Crop Science Division. For further
information, see Chapter 8 ‚ÄúProduct Stewardship.‚Äù

221

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

Another risk we face is that of illegal trading of counterfeit medicines and crop protection products by
criminal third parties. In most cases, the composition and / or the quality of counterfeit products do not
correspond to those of the original products. In addition, the fact that no local regulatory authority is
involved in assuring the quality of the manufacturing or distribution process precludes any official
product recall. Products originating from illegal third-party manufacturing not only endanger patients,
users, animals and the environment, but also jeopardize the good reputation of our company and products and undermine our competitive position.
Bayer actively assists authorities‚Äô efforts to combat product counterfeiting by adopting preventive
measures and prosecuting offenders.
PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION
To ensure the sustainability of our activities along the entire value chain, Bayer has introduced a
Supplier Code of Conduct. This sets forth our sustainability principles, explains what we expect from
our partners and requires them to observe our standards in areas including environmental protection
and occupational safety. A further essential element is the respect of human rights. This means, for
example, that no form of child labor may be employed. Violations of the Code may harm our company‚Äôs
reputation. Through supplier assessments and audits, we verify whether our partners along the supply
chain actually implement and comply with our Code of Conduct (see Chapter 7 ‚ÄúProcurement, Production, Logistics and Distribution‚Äù).
Despite its modern facilities and optimized manufacturing processes, Bayer requires significant quantities of energy and petrochemical feedstocks for the production of chemicals. Procurement prices for
energy and raw materials may fluctuate significantly. This can provide opportunities but may also put
our product margins at risk when oil prices are low, for example. Experience has shown that higher
production costs cannot always be passed on to our customers through price adjustments. This applies
especially to Covestro.
We attach great importance not only to product safety but also to protecting our employees and the
environment. Risks associated with the manufacturing, filling, storage or shipping of products are mitigated by means of integrated quality, health, environmental protection and safety management. The
materialization of such risks may result in personal injury, property and environmental damage, loss of
production, business interruptions and / or liability for compensation payments.
Operations at our sites may be disrupted by natural disasters, fires or explosions, sabotage or supply
shortages for our principal raw materials or intermediates. Disruption may also result from possible
regulatory or legislative changes in the respective countries. The complexity of multistage manufacturing processes for active ingredients or biotechnology products strengthens the potential for disruption
and may limit product availability. If we are unable to meet demand, sales may undergo a structural
decline. We counter this risk by distributing production for certain products among multiple sites or by
building up safety stocks. Furthermore, an emergency response system has been implemented for all
our production sites as a mandatory component of our hseq management. It is aimed at protecting
employees, neighbors, the environment and production facilities from the risks described. The Group
Regulation ‚ÄúSafety and Crisis Management‚Äù forms the basis for this.

222

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

Increased ecological awareness creates opportunities for Covestro in two ways. On the one hand, the
development of innovative materials for our customers (see Chapter 4 ‚ÄúResearch, Development, Innovation‚Äù) opens up market potential. On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing the energy efficiency of
our own production processes, we can mitigate environmental impacts and achieve cost savings at the
same time. By developing new production technologies and applying internationally recognized energy
management systems, we aim to help meet increasing environmental requirements, further reduce
emissions and waste, and increase energy efficiency. In this way we not only contribute to sustainable
climate protection and the conservation of natural resources, but also achieve cost and competitive
advantages.
EMPLOYEES
Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for the company‚Äôs success. There is keen competition
among companies for highly qualified personnel, particularly in countries with full employment and in
the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America. If we are unable to recruit a sufficient number of
employees in these countries and retain them within Bayer, this could have significant adverse consequences for the company‚Äôs future development.
Based on our analysis of future requirements, we design appropriate employee recruitment and development measures. These include extensive employer marketing activities, such as our employer branding campaign, aimed at convincing our target groups of the advantages of working for Bayer. Competitive compensation containing performance-related components as well as an extensive range of training
and development opportunities are among the essential elements of our human resources policies,
which are based on the principles enshrined in our Human Rights Position, our corporate values and
our Corporate Compliance Policy. In addition, our focus on diversity enables us to tap the full potential
of the employment market. In times of considerable strategic and organizational transition at Bayer,
deliberate and transparent change management forms an integral part of our human resources management, enabling us to motivate our employees for the long term and alleviate uncertainties.
For more information, see Chapter 6 ‚ÄúEmployees.‚Äù
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Business and production processes and the internal and external communications of the Bayer Group
are increasingly dependent on global it systems.
A significant technical disruption or failure of it systems could severely impair our business and production processes. Technical precautions such as data recovery and continuity plans are defined and
continuously evolved in close cooperation with our internal it organization.
The confidentiality of internal and external data is of fundamental importance to us. A loss of data confidentiality, integrity or authenticity could lead to manipulation and / or the uncontrolled outflow of data
and know-how. We have measures in place to counter this risk, including an authorization system.
Furthermore, a committee has been established to determine the fundamental strategy, architecture and
safety measures for the Bayer Group. These measures are designed to provide optimum protection
based on state-of-the-art technology.

223

Bayer Annual Report 2015

18. Future Perspectives

LAW AND COMPLIANCE
The Bayer Group is exposed to risks from legal disputes or proceedings to which we are currently a
party or which could arise in the future, particularly in the areas of product liability, competition and
antitrust law, patent law, tax law and environmental protection.
Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations, such as potential infringements of antitrust law
or certain marketing and / or distribution methods, may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties ‚Äì including substantial monetary fines ‚Äì and / or other adverse financial consequences, harm
Bayer‚Äôs reputation and ultimately hamper our commercial success.
Bayer has established a global compliance management system to ensure the sustainable observance of
laws and regulations (see Chapter 16.3 ‚ÄúCompliance‚Äù).
Legal proceedings currently considered to involve material risks are described in note [32] to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS
The Bayer Group has financial opportunities at its disposal in the form of the market prices it can command, and is exposed to financial risks in the form of liquidity, credit and market price risks, as well as
risks resulting from pension obligations.
The following paragraphs provide details of these and other financial opportunities and risks and how
they are managed.
The management of financial opportunities and risks takes place using established, documented processes. One component is financial planning, which serves as the basis for determining the liquidity risk
and the future foreign currency and interest-rate risks and covers all Group companies that are relevant
from a cash-flow perspective. Financial planning comprises a planning horizon of 12 months and is
regularly updated.
Further information is provided in Chapter 14.7 ‚ÄúFinancial Management of the Group.‚Äù

See Chapter 14.7

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risks result from the possible inability of the Bayer Group to meet current or future payment
obligations due to a lack of cash or cash equivalents. The liquidity risk is determined and managed by
the Finance department as part of our same-day and medium-term liquidity planning.
Payment obligations from financial instruments are explained according to their maturity in note [30.2]
to the consolidated financial statements.
The Bayer Group holds sufficient liquidity to ensure the fulfillment of all planned payment obligations at
maturity. In addition, a reserve is maintained for unbudgeted shortfalls in cash receipts or unexpected
disbursements. The amount of this liquidity reserve is regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary
according to circumstances.
Liquid assets are held mainly in the form of overnight and term deposits. Credit facilities also exist with
banks. These include, in particular, an undrawn ‚Ç¨3.5 billion syndicated credit facility. Additionally, credit
facilities totaling ‚Ç¨2.7 billion are available to the Covestro Group.

224

Bayer Annual Report 2015

18. Future Perspectives

Credit risks
Credit risks arise from the possibility that the value of receivables or other financial assets of the Bayer
Group may be impaired because counterparties cannot meet their payment or other performance obligations. The Bayer Group does not conclude master netting arrangements with its customers for nonderivative financial instruments. Here, the total value of the financial assets represents the maximum
credit risk exposure. In the case of derivatives, positive and negative market values may be netted under
certain conditions.
To manage credit risks from trade receivables, the respective invoicing companies appoint credit managers who regularly analyze customers‚Äô creditworthiness. Some of these receivables are collateralized,
and the collateral is used according to local conditions. It includes credit insurance, advance payments,
letters of credit and guarantees. Reservation of title is generally agreed with our customers. Credit limits
are set for all customers. All credit limits for debtors where total exposure is ‚Ç¨10 million or more are
evaluated by local credit management and submitted to the Bayer Group‚Äôs Financial Risk Committee.
Credit risks from financial transactions are managed centrally in the finance department. To minimize
risks, financial transactions are only conducted within predefined exposure limits and with banks and
other partners that preferably have investment-grade ratings. All risk limits are based on methodical
models. Adherence to the risk limits is continuously monitored.

Consolidated
Financial

Note 30.3

Opportunities and risks resulting from market price changes
Opportunities and risks resulting from changes in market currency and interest rates are managed by
the central finance department. Risks are eliminated or mitigated through the use of derivative financial
instruments. Further details on derivatives are given in note [30.3] to the consolidated financial statements.
The type and level of currency and interest-rate risks are explained in the following paragraphs using
sensitivity analyses based on hypothetical changes in risk variables (such as interest curves) to determine the potential effects of market price fluctuations on equity and earnings. The assumptions used in
the sensitivity analyses reflect our view of the changes in currency exchange and interest rates that are
reasonably possible over a one-year period. These assumptions are regularly reviewed.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency opportunities and risks for the Bayer Group result from changes in exchange rates and
the related changes in the value of financial instruments (including receivables and payables) and of
anticipated payment receipts and disbursements in the functional currency.
Receivables and payables in liquid currencies from operating activities and financial items are generally
fully exchange-hedged through forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest-rate swaps.
Anticipated exposure from planned payment receipts and disbursement in the future is hedged according to the rules agreed between the Board of Management, the finance department and the operating
units. Hedging takes place through forward exchange contracts and currency options.
Sensitivities were determined on the basis of a hypothetical adverse scenario in which the euro depreciates by 10% against all other currencies compared with the year-end exchange rates. In this scenario,
the estimated hypothetical loss of cash flows from derivative and nonderivative financial instruments
would have diminished earnings and equity (other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2015 by
‚Ç¨303 million (December 31, 2014: ‚Ç¨295 million). Of this amount, ‚Ç¨108 million is related to the u.s. dollar, ‚Ç¨66 million to the Chinese renminbi, ‚Ç¨41 million to the Japanese yen and ‚Ç¨28 million to the Canadian dollar. Currency effects on anticipated exposure are not taken into account.

225

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Combined Management Report
18. Future Perspectives

Derivatives used to hedge anticipated currency exposure that are designated for hedge accounting
would have diminished other comprehensive income by ‚Ç¨313 million.
Interest rates
Interest-rate opportunities and risks result for the Bayer Group through changes in capital market interest rates, which in turn could lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments and
changes in interest payments in the case of floating-rate instruments.
Interest-rate opportunities and risks are managed over a target duration established by management for
Bayer Group debt. This target duration is subject to regular review. Interest-rate swaps are concluded to
achieve the target structure for Bayer Group debt.
A sensitivity analysis based on our net floating-rate receivables and payables position at year end 2015,
taking into account the interest rates relevant for our receivables and payables in all principal currencies, produced the following result: a hypothetical increase of 1 percentage point in these interest rates
(assuming constant currency exchange rates) as of January 1, 2015 would have raised our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 by ‚Ç¨29 million (December 31, 2014: ‚Ç¨53 million).
Financial risks associated with pension obligations
The Bayer Group has obligations to current and former employees related to pensions and other postemployment benefits. Changes in relevant measurement parameters such as interest rates, mortality
and salary increase rates may raise the present value of our pension obligations. This may lead to increased costs for pension plans or diminish equity due to actuarial losses being recognized as other
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income. A large proportion of our pension
and other post-employment benefit obligations is covered by plan assets including fixed-income securities, shares, real estate and other investments. Declining or even negative returns on these investments
may adversely affect the future fair value of plan assets. Both these effects may negatively impact the
development of equity and / or the company‚Äôs earnings and / or may necessitate additional payments by
the company. Further details are given in note [25] to the consolidated financial statements.
We address the risk of market-related fluctuations in the fair value of our plan assets through balanced
strategic investment, and we constantly monitor investment risks in regard to our global pension obligations.
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS
The risks reported above do not endanger the company‚Äôs continued existence. Nor could we identify
any risk interdependencies that could combine to endanger the company‚Äôs continued existence.
Risks rated as ‚Äúmedium‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh‚Äù did not change significantly compared with the previous year.
Based on our product portfolio, our know-how and our innovation strength, we are convinced that we
can take advantage of the opportunities resulting from our entrepreneurial activity and successfully
master the challenges resulting from the risks stated above.

Explanatory report pursuant to Sections 289, Paragraph 4 and 315, Paragraph 4 of the
German Commercial Code (HGB)
The capital stock of Bayer AG amounted as of December 31, 2015 to ‚Ç¨2,117 million, divided into
826,947,808 no-par registered shares. The capital stock and the number of shares were thus unchanged
from the end of the previous year. Each share confers one voting right.
A small number of shares may be subject to temporary trading restrictions, such as retention periods, in
connection with employee stock participation programs.
We received no notifications in 2015 of direct or indirect holdings of shares in Bayer AG that exceed
10% of the capital stock. The company thus is not in possession of any notifications of holdings that
exceed 10% of the capital stock.

The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management are subject to the provisions
of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Section 31 of the German Codetermination
Act and Section 6 of the company‚Äôs Articles of Incorporation. Pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Board of Management are appointed and dismissed
by the Supervisory Board. Since Bayer AG falls within the scope of the German Codetermination Act,
the appointment or dismissal of members of the Board of Management requires a majority of two thirds
of the votes of the members of the Supervisory Board on the first ballot pursuant to Section 31, Paragraph 2 of that act. If no such majority is achieved, the appointment is resolved pursuant to Section 31,
Paragraph 3 of the Codetermination Act on a second ballot by a simple majority of the votes of the
members of the Supervisory Board. If the required majority still is not achieved, a third ballot is held.
Here again, a simple majority of the votes of the members suffices, but in this ballot the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board has two votes pursuant to Section 31, Paragraph 4 of the Codetermination Act. Under Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation of Bayer AG, the number of members of the
Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board but must be at least two. The Supervisory Board may appoint one member of the Board of Management to be the Chairman of the Board of
Management pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 6,
Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation.
Any amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made pursuant to Section 179 of the German Stock
Corporation Act and Sections 10 and 17 of the Articles of Incorporation. Under Section 179, Paragraph
1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation require a resolution of the Stockholders‚Äô Meeting. Pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, this resolution must be passed by a majority of three quarters of the voting capital represented
at the meeting, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different majority. However, where an
amendment relates to a change in the object of the company, the Articles of Incorporation may only
specify a larger majority. Section 17, Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation of Bayer AG utilizes
the scope for deviation pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act and
provides that resolutions may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast or, where a capital majority is required, by a simple majority of the capital represented. Pursuant to Section 10, Paragraph 6 of
the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may resolve on amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that relate solely to their wording.
Provisions of the Articles of Incorporation concerning Authorized Capital i and Authorized Capital ii are
entered in the commercial register of Bayer AG. With the approval of the Supervisory Board and until
April 28, 2019, the Board of Management may use the Authorized Capital i to increase the capital stock
by up to a total of ‚Ç¨530 million. New shares may be issued against cash contributions and / or contributions in kind, but capital increases against contributions in kind may not exceed a total of ‚Ç¨423 million.
If the Authorized Capital i is used to issue shares in return for cash contributions, stockholders must
normally be granted subscription rights. The Board of Management may only exclude stockholders‚Äô
subscription rights to a volume of shares issued out of the Authorized Capital i that did not represent
more than 20% of the existing capital stock at the time the respective resolution was adopted by the
Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014. Absent a further resolution on the exclusion of stock-

227

holders‚Äô subscription rights, the Board of Management also may only exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights to a volume of shares issued under other authorizations regarding capital measures (Authorized Capital ii, bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, purchase and disposal of own shares) that did
not represent more than 20% of the existing capital stock at the time the respective resolution was
adopted by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014.
With the approval of the Supervisory Board and until April 28, 2019, the Board of Management is authorized to increase the capital stock by up to ‚Ç¨212 million in one or more installments by issuing
shares out of the Authorized Capital ii against cash contributions. The stockholders must normally be
granted subscription rights. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the approval of the
Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights for stockholders provided the volume of shares issued
out of the Authorized Capital ii against cash contributions does not exceed 10% of the capital stock
existing at the time this authorization is registered or at the time the new shares are issued and the
issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the market price of the already listed shares.
Conditional capital of ‚Ç¨212 million exists in connection with an authorization ‚Äì valid through April 28,
2019 ‚Äì to issue bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, profit-sharing rights or profit participation
bonds (collectively referred to as ‚Äúbonds‚Äù) with a total face value of ‚Ç¨6 billion. The Board of Management may, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and under certain conditions, exclude the bond
subscription rights that would otherwise be granted to stockholders. One of the conditions is that the
total volume of shares required to service the bonds exceed neither 10% of the capital stock that existed at the time the respective resolution was adopted by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29,
2014 nor 10% of the capital stock existing at the time this authorization is exercised. Any other shares
issued without granting subscription rights to the stockholders in direct or analogous application of
Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act shall be credited against this
10% limit. Further, by resolution of the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014, the Board of
Management is authorized to purchase and dispose of own shares representing up to 10% of the capital
stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted. The authorization to purchase own shares also
includes the purchase of own shares using put or call options (derivatives) up to a volume of 5% of the
capital stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted or at the time the authorization is exercised. This authorization also expires on April 28, 2019.
A material agreement that is subject to the condition precedent of a change of control pertains to the
undrawn ‚Ç¨3.5 billion syndicated credit facility arranged by Bayer AG and its u.s. subsidiary Bayer Corporation. This facility is available until December 2020. The participating banks are entitled to terminate
the credit facility in the event of a change of control at Bayer and demand repayment of any loans that
may have been granted under this facility up to that time. A similar clause is contained in the agreement
on a syndicated credit facility granted to Bayer subsidiary Bayer World Investments b.v., Netherlands, in
2014 and guaranteed by Bayer AG. The facility still amounts to us$900 million (as of December 31, 2015)
and matures in May 2018.
The terms of the nominal ‚Ç¨4.2 billion (as of December 31, 2015) in notes issued by Bayer in the years
2006 to 2014 under its multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program also contain a change-ofcontrol clause. Holders of these notes have the right to demand the redemption of their notes by Bayer
AG in the event of a change of control if Bayer AG‚Äôs credit rating is downgraded within 120 days after
such change of control becomes effective. The terms of the us$7 billion bond in 144a / Reg S format
issued in October 2014 also contain a clause to this effect.
Agreements exist for the members of the Board of Management in compliance with Section 4.2.3 of the
German Corporate Governance Code to cover the eventuality of a takeover offer being made for
Bayer AG. Under these agreements, payments promised in the event of early termination of the service
contract of a Board of Management member due to a change of control are limited to the value of three
years‚Äô compensation and may not compensate more than the remaining term of the contract.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

2. General information
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group as of December 31, 2015, were prepared by BayerAktiengesellschaft (Bayer AG) according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs) issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (iasb), London, and the interpretations of the ifrs Interpretations Committee (ifrs ic), both as endorsed by the European Union and in effect at the end of the reporting period. The applicable further requirements of Section 315a of the German Commercial Code were also taken into account.
Bayer AG is a global enterprise based in Germany. Its registered office is at Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee 1, 51368
Leverkusen. Its material business activities in the fields of health care, agriculture and high-tech polymer materials
took place in the reporting period in the HealthCare, CropScience and Covestro subgroups. The activities of the
various segments are outlined in note [5].
A declaration concerning the German Corporate Governance Code has been issued pursuant to Section 161 of the
German Stock Corporation Act and made available to stockholders.
The Board of Management of Bayer AG prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group on
February 16, 2016. They were discussed by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG at its meeting on February 23, 2016, and approved by the Supervisory Board at its plenary meeting on February 24, 2016.
In the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, statement of cash
flows and statement of changes in equity, certain items are combined for the sake of clarity. These are explained in
the Notes. The income statement is prepared using the cost-of-sales method. Assets and liabilities are classified by
maturity. They are regarded as current if they mature within one year or within the normal business cycle of the
company or the Group, or are held for sale. The normal business cycle is defined for this purpose as beginning
with the procurement of the resources necessary for the production process and ending with the receipt of cash or
cash equivalents as consideration for the sale of the goods or services produced in that process. Inventories and
trade accounts receivable and payable are always presented as current items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and
pension provisions are always presented as noncurrent items.
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group are drawn up in euros. Amounts are stated in millions of
euros (‚Ç¨ million) except where otherwise indicated.
The financial statements of the individual consolidated companies are prepared as of the closing date of the Group
financial statements.

3. Effects of new financial reporting standards
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS APPLIED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2015
In December 2013, the iasb published the fifth and sixth sets of ‚ÄúAnnual Improvements to ifrss.‚Äù The amendments
address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions and serve to standardize
terminology. They consist mainly of editorial changes to existing standards. The first-time application of these
amendments had no material impact on the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations, or on
earnings per share.
PUBLISHED FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN APPLIED
The iasb and the ifrs Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards, amendments to standards,
and interpretations whose application was not yet mandatory for the 2015 fiscal year and is conditional upon their
endorsement by the European Union.

239

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In November 2009, the iasb issued ifrs 9 (Financial Instruments), containing rules for the classification and measurement of financial assets. In October 2010, it issued new requirements for the classification and measurement of
financial liabilities, incorporating them into ifrs 9. The new standard defines two instead of four measurement
categories for financial assets, with classification to be based partly on the company‚Äôs business model and partly on
the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the respective financial asset. In the case of equity investments that are not held for trading, an entity may irrevocably opt at initial recognition to recognize future changes
in their fair value outside profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. In November 2013, the iasb
issued further amendments under the title ‚ÄúHedge Accounting and amendments to ifrs 9, ifrs 7 and ias 39.‚Äù The
focus of the amendments is on a thorough revision of hedge accounting rules with the aim of more appropriately
reflecting risk management activities in the financial statements. This involves additional disclosures in the notes.
In July 2014, the iasb published the new rules for the disclosure of financial instrument impairments. This new
impairment model is based on the principle of accounting for expected losses. It also introduces a third measurement category ‚Äúfair value through other comprehensive income‚Äù for certain debt instruments. ifrs 9 is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the
European Union. Bayer is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on the presentation of the Group‚Äôs
financial position and results of operations.
In January 2014, the iasb issued ifrs 14 (Regulatory Deferral Accounts). This standard addresses the accounting
for regulatory deferral account balances by first-time adopters of the ifrs and therefore does not apply to entities
that already prepare their financial statements according to the ifrs. ifrs 14 is to be applied for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. ifrs 14 will
have no impact on the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In May 2014, the iasb published amendments to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) and ias 38 (Intangible
Assets) entitled "Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation." These amendments clarify
that revenue-based depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of intangible assets is inappropriate. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. They will have
no impact on the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In May 2014, the iasb published amendments to ifrs 11 (Joint Arrangements) entitled "Accounting for Acquisitions
of Interests in Joint Operations." The amendments clarify the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint
operation in which the activity constitutes a business. They are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2016. The possible impact on the future presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position and results of
operations depends on future acquisitions of interests in joint operations. These cannot be reliably predicted.
In May 2014, the iasb issued ifrs 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). ifrs 15 is the new standard for
revenue recognition. It clarifies that the expected consideration for goods or services must be recognized as revenue when the goods or intangible assets are transferred or the services are rendered to the customer. This principle is applied in five steps. In step 1, the contract with the customer is identified. In step 2, the distinct performance obligations in the contract are identified. In step 3, the transaction price is determined. In step 4, this transaction price is allocated to the distinct performance obligations. Finally, in step 5, revenue is recognized when the
identified distinct performance obligations are satisfied, either over time or at a point in time. ifrs 15 replaces
ias 11 (Construction Contracts), ias 18 (Revenue), ifric 13 (Customer Loyalty Programmes), ifric 15 (Agreements
for the Construction of Real Estate), ifric 18 (Transfers of Assets from Customers) and sic-31 (Revenue-Barter
Transactions Involving Advertising Services). An amendment to ifrs 15 was issued in September 2015, deferring
the date of first-time application from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018. The new standard is thus to be applied
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the European
Union. Bayer is currently evaluating the impact the changes will have on the presentation of its financial position
and results of operations.

240

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In June 2014, the iasb issued amendments to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) and ias 41 (Agriculture) entitled "Agriculture: Bearer Plants." The amendments clarify that plants used solely to grow agricultural produce are
to be accounted for according to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment). The amendments are to be applied for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on
the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In September 2014, the iasb published the seventh set of ‚ÄúAnnual Improvements to ifrss.‚Äù The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions and serve to standardize
terminology. They consist mainly of editorial changes to existing standards. They are applicable for annual periods
beginning on or after July 1, 2016. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of
Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In September 2014, the iasb published amendments to ifrs 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) and ias 28
(Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) entitled "Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture." The amendments clarify that in a transaction involving an associate or joint venture the
extent of gain or loss recognition depends on whether the assets sold or contributed constitute a business. An
amendment issued in December 2015 indefinitely defers the effective date of the September 2014 amendments,
which were originally intended to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The iasb is
to set a new effective date.
In December 2014, further amendments were issued to ifrs 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), ifrs 12 (Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) and ias 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) entitled "Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception." The amendments largely clarify which subsidiaries an investment entity must consolidate and which must be recognized at fair value through profit or loss. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The amendments have not yet
been endorsed by the European Union. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In December 2014, the iasb published amendments to ias 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) under its Disclosure Initiative. The amendments are intended to clarify the disclosure requirements and relate to materiality,
line-item aggregation, subtotals, the structure of the notes to the financial statements, the identification of significant accounting policies and the separate disclosure of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint
ventures. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of Bayer‚Äôs financial position or results of operations.
In January 2016, the iasb issued ifrs 16 (Leases), the new standard for lease accounting. ifrs 16 introduces a
uniform lease accounting model for lessees, requiring recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases with a term
of more than 12 months unless such leases are immaterial. It will eliminate the current requirement for lessees to
classify leases as either operating leases ‚Äì without recognizing the respective assets or liabilities ‚Äì or as finance
leases. The new standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The standard
has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. Bayer is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have
on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In January 2016, the iasb published amendments to ias 12 (Income Taxes) under the title ‚ÄúRecognition of Deferred
Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses.‚Äù These amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets related to debt
instruments measured at fair value. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2017. They have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. Bayer is currently evaluating the impact
the changes will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.

241

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In January 2016, the iasb published amendments to ias 7 (Statement of Cash Flows) under its Disclosure Initiative.
The following changes in liabilities arising from financing activities must be disclosed in the future: (i) changes
from financing cash flows; (ii) changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses;
(iii) the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; (iv) changes in fair values; (v) other changes. The amendments
are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. They have not yet been endorsed by the
European Union. Bayer is currently evaluating the impact the changes will have on the presentation of its financial
position and results of operations.

4. Basic principles, methods and critical accounting estimates
The financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared according to uniform accounting policies and
measurement principles.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are based on the principle of the historical cost of acquisition,
construction or production, with the exception of the items reflected at fair value, such as financial assets held for
trading or available for sale, and derivatives.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management has to make certain assumptions and estimates that may substantially impact the presentation of the Group‚Äôs financial position and / or results of operations.
Such estimates, assumptions or the exercise of discretion mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets, the
discounted cash flows used for impairment testing and purchase price allocations, and the recognition of provisions, including those for litigation-related expenses, pensions and other benefits, taxes, environmental compliance
and remediation costs, sales allowances, product liability and guarantees. Essential estimates and assumptions that
may affect reporting in the various item categories of the financial statements are described in the following sections of this note. Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under given circumstances. They are continually reviewed but may vary from the actual values.
Changes in accounting policies or measurement principles in light of new or revised standards are applied retrospectively, except as otherwise provided in the respective standard. The income statement for the previous year
and the opening statement of financial position for that year are adjusted as if the new accounting policies and / or
measurement principles had always been applied.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates.
Subsidiaries are companies over which Bayer AG is currently able to exercise power by virtue of existing rights.
Power means the ability to direct the activities that significantly influence a company‚Äôs profitability. Control is
therefore only deemed to exist if Bayer AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with a
company and has the ability to use its power over that company to affect the amount of that company‚Äôs returns.
The ability to control another company generally derives from Bayer AG‚Äôs direct or indirect ownership of a majority
of the voting rights. In the case of structured entities, however, control is based on contractual agreements. Inclusion of an entity‚Äôs accounts in the consolidated financial statements begins when the Bayer Group is able to exercise control over the entity and ceases when it is no longer able to do so.
Sales revenues, income and expenses, and gains and losses arising from transactions among the consolidated
companies, along with receivables and liabilities existing between them, are eliminated. Deferred income tax effects are reflected in consolidation.

242

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the carrying amounts of subsidiaries against their underlying equity. When a majority interest in a company is acquired, its pro-rated equity at the acquisition date is measured using
the acquisition method. Identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are recognized at their
fair values along with attributable deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any remaining difference to the purchase price
is recognized as goodwill. The purchase prices of acquired companies domiciled outside the eurozone are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the respective dates of acquisition.
The purchase of shares from other owners is presented as an equity transaction. The difference between the equity
acquired from other owners and the purchase price is therefore directly offset against equity.
Joint operations and joint ventures are based on joint arrangements. A joint arrangement is deemed to exist if the
Bayer Group through a contractual agreement jointly controls activities managed with a third party. Joint control is
only deemed to exist if decisions regarding the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties
sharing control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights
to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Bayer Group recognizes the share
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with its rights
and obligations.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to
the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Associates over which Bayer AG exerts significant influence, generally through an ownership interest between
20% and 50%, also are accounted for using the equity method.
The carrying amount of a company accounted for using the equity method is adjusted annually by the percentage
of any change in its equity corresponding to Bayer‚Äôs percentage interest in the company. Differences arising upon
first-time inclusion using the equity method were accounted for according to full-consolidation principles. Bayer‚Äôs
share of changes in these companies‚Äô equities recognized in profit or loss ‚Äì including impairment losses recognized on goodwill ‚Äì are reflected in equity-method income / loss.
Companies that do not have a material impact on the Group‚Äôs financial position or results of operations, either
individually or in aggregate, are accounted for at cost of acquisition less any impairment losses.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of the individual companies for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements are
prepared in their respective functional currencies. A company‚Äôs functional currency is that of the economic environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash. The majority of combined companies carry out their
activities autonomously from a financial, economic and organizational point of view, and their functional currencies
are therefore the respective local currencies.
In the separate financial statements of the individual consolidated companies, receivables and liabilities in currencies other than the respective functional currency are translated at closing rates. Related exchange differences are
recognized in profit or loss as exchange gains or losses under other financial income and expenses.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of companies outside the eurozone at the start
and end of the year are translated into euros at closing rates. All changes occurring during the year and all income
and expense items and cash flows are translated into euros at average monthly rates. Equity components are translated at the historical exchange rates prevailing at the respective dates of their first-time recognition in Group
equity.

243

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The exchange differences arising between the resulting amounts and those obtained by translating at closing rates
are recognized outside profit or loss as ‚ÄúExchange differences on translation of operations outside the eurozone‚Äù
(in other comprehensive income) or ‚ÄúExchange differences‚Äù (in the tables in the notes). When a company is deconsolidated, such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
The exchange rates for major currencies against the euro varied as follows:

Subsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the
past three years apply the rules of ias 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies). Gains and losses
incurred upon adjusting the carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets and liabilities for inflation are recognized in
other operating income and expenses.
In 2015, as in prior years, the rules of ias 29 were relevant for Bayer s.a., Venezuela.
Several widely differing official exchange rates for the Venezuelan bolivar (vef) against the u.s. dollar were published in 2014. Bayer s.a., Venezuela, was included in the consolidated financial statements for 2014 at the official
exchange rate potentially applicable to future capital transfers if permission for conversion into u.s. dollars is
granted (sicad i).
In 2015, a further official exchange rate (simadi) was introduced. In view of the low u.s. dollar allocation at the
more favorable government-subsidized exchange rates and the continued deterioration in the Venezuelan economy, currency translation was switched to the simadi rate. The resulting u.s. dollar amount is translated at the respective dollar / euro rate.
As of December 31, 2015, Bayer s.a., Venezuela, had trade accounts equivalent to ‚Ç¨121 million (2014: ‚Ç¨150 million)
payable to other Group companies in u.s. dollars. Impairment losses of ‚Ç¨91 million were recognized on receivables
in 2015 because the Venezuelan exchange control authority did not allocate u.s. dollars at the subsidized exchange
rate with respect to the full amounts of older receivables. Hyperinflationary exchange gains of ‚Ç¨43 million were
incurred in 2015 (2014: losses of ‚Ç¨59 million), mainly from the net foreign currency position, in connection with the
depreciation of the vef against the u.s. dollar.
NET SALES AND OTHER OPERATING INCOME
All revenues derived from the selling of products or rendering of services or from licensing agreements are recognized as sales. Other operational revenues are recognized as other operating income. Sales are recognized in
profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred
can be measured reliably, and it is sufficiently probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction
will flow to the company.

244

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Sales are stated net of sales taxes, other taxes and sales deductions at the fair value of the consideration received
or to be received. Sales deductions are estimated amounts for rebates, cash discounts and product returns. They
are deducted at the time the sales are recognized, and appropriate provisions are recorded. Sales deductions are
estimated primarily on the basis of historical experience, specific contractual terms and future expectations of sales
development. It is unlikely that factors other than these could materially affect sales deductions in the Bayer Group.
Adjustments to provisions made in prior periods for rebates, cash discounts or product returns were of secondary
importance for income before income taxes in the years under report.
Provisions for rebates in 2015 amounted to 3.8% of total net sales (2014: 3.4%). In addition to rebates, Group
companies offer cash discounts for prompt payment in some countries. Provisions for cash discounts as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were less than 0.1% of total net sales for the respective year.
Sales are reduced by the amount of the provisions for expected returns of defective goods or of saleable products
that may be returned under contractual arrangements. The net sales are reduced on the date of sale or on the date
when the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for product returns in 2015 amounted
to 0.4% of total net sales (2014: 0.5%). If future product returns cannot be reasonably estimated and are significant to a sales transaction, the revenues and the related cost of sales are deferred until a reasonable estimate can
be made or the right to return the goods has expired.
Some of the Bayer Group‚Äôs revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third parties
have been granted rights to products and technologies. Payments received, or expected to be received, that relate
to the sale or outlicensing of technologies or technological expertise are recognized in profit or loss as of the effective date of the respective agreement if all rights relating to the technologies and all obligations resulting from
them have been relinquished under the contract terms. However, if rights to the technologies continue to exist or
obligations resulting from them have yet to be fulfilled, the payments received are deferred accordingly. Upfront
payments and similar nonrefundable payments received under these agreements are recorded as other liabilities
and recognized in profit or loss according to the degree of performance over the estimated performance period
stipulated in the agreement.
License agreements and research and development collaboration agreements may be multiple-deliverable arrangements with varying consideration terms, such as upfront payments and milestone or similar payments. Such
agreements therefore have to be assessed to determine whether the revenues allocated to individual deliverables
must be recognized at different points in time and therefore form separate units of account.
To qualify as a separate unit of account for revenue recognition purposes, a deliverable must have value to the
licensee on a standalone basis. If this is not the case, the agreement as a whole or a combination of individual
deliverables that has value on a standalone basis forms a unit of account.
If necessary goods have yet to be delivered or necessary services provided for a unit of account and such delivery
or provision is probable, nonrefundable (royalty) payments already received are recognized through profit or loss
over the periods in which these goods are delivered or these services are provided.
Income may also arise from the exchange of intangible assets. The amount recognized is generally based on the
fair value of the assets given up, calculated using the discounted cash flow method. If the assets given up are internally generated, the gain from the exchange generally equals their fair value.

245

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
For accounting purposes, research expenses are defined as costs incurred for current or planned investigations
undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. Development
expenses are defined as costs incurred for the application of research findings or specialist knowledge to plans or
designs for the production, provision or development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes, respectively, prior to the commencement of commercial production or use.
Research and development expenses are incurred in the Bayer Group for in-house research and development activities as well as numerous research and development collaborations and alliances with third parties.
Research and development expenses mainly comprise the costs for active ingredient discovery, clinical studies,
research and development activities in the areas of application technology and engineering, field trials, regulatory
approvals and approval extensions.
Research costs cannot be capitalized. The conditions for capitalization of development costs are closely defined: an
intangible asset must be recognized if, and only if, there is reasonable certainty of receiving future cash flows that
will cover an asset‚Äôs carrying amount. Since our own development projects are often subject to regulatory approval
procedures and other uncertainties, the conditions for the capitalization of costs incurred before receipt of approvals are not normally satisfied.
In the case of research and development collaborations, a distinction is generally made between payments on
contract signature, upfront payments, milestone payments and cost reimbursements for work performed. If an
intangible asset (such as the right to the use of an active ingredient) is acquired in connection with any of these
payment obligations, the respective payment is capitalized even if it is uncertain whether further development work
will ultimately lead to the production of a saleable product. Reimbursements of the cost of research or development
work are recognized in profit or loss, except where they are required to be capitalized.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable income in the individual countries along with changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss. The income taxes recognized are reflected at
the amounts likely to be payable under the statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future
periods, at the end of the reporting period.
In compliance with ias 12 (Income Taxes), deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position prepared according to ifrs and their
tax bases. Deferred taxes are also recognized for consolidation measures and for tax loss carryforwards and tax
credits that are likely to be usable.
Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences, tax credits or tax loss carryforwards are recognized where it is sufficiently probable that taxable income will be available in the future to enable them to be used.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred taxes are calculated
at the rates which ‚Äì on the basis of the statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future periods, as of the closing date ‚Äì are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization. Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and
Bayer has a legal right to settle on a net basis. Material effects of changes in tax rates or tax law on deferred tax
assets and liabilities are generally accounted for in the period in which the changes are enacted. Such effects are
recognized in profit or loss except where they relate to deferred taxes that were recognized outside profit or loss,
in which case they are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Deferred and current taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside profit or
loss in other comprehensive income, in which case they, too, are recognized in other comprehensive income.

246

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The probability that deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or loss carryforwards can be used in
the future is the subject of forecasts by the individual consolidated companies regarding their future earnings
situation and other parameters.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on planned dividend payments by subsidiaries. Where no dividend payment
is planned for the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to ifrs and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary.
GOODWILL
In a business combination, goodwill is capitalized at the acquisition date. It is measured at its cost of acquisition,
which is the excess of the acquisition price for shares in a company over the acquired net assets. The net assets are
the balance of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment. Details of the annual impairment tests are given
under ‚ÄúProcedure used in global impairment testing and its impact.‚Äù Once an impairment loss has been recognized
on goodwill, it is not reversed in subsequent periods.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An ‚Äúother intangible asset‚Äù is an identifiable nonmonetary asset without physical substance, other than goodwill
(such as a patent, a trademark or a marketing right). It is capitalized if the future economic benefits attributable to
the asset will probably flow to the company and the cost of acquisition or generation of the asset can be reliably
measured.
Other intangible assets are recognized at the cost of acquisition or generation. Those with a determinable useful
life are amortized accordingly on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 30 years, except where their actual
depletion demands a different amortization pattern. Determination of the expected useful lives of such assets and
the amortization patterns is based on estimates of the period for which they will generate cash flows. An impairment test is performed if there is an indication of possible impairment.
Other intangible assets with an indefinite life (such as the Bayer Cross trademark) and intangible assets not yet
available for use (such as research and development projects) are not amortized, but tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. If the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss
no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed provided that the reversal does not cause the carrying amount to
exceed the (amortized) cost of acquisition or generation.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over its estimated useful life. An impairment loss is recognized in addition if an asset‚Äôs recoverable amount falls below its carrying
amount.
The cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment comprises the direct cost of materials, direct manufacturing expenses, and appropriate allocations of material and manufacturing overheads. Where an obligation exists
to dismantle or remove an asset or restore a site to its former condition at the end of its useful life, the present
value of the related future payments is capitalized along with the cost of acquisition or construction upon completion and a corresponding liability is recognized.
If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends over a substantial period of time, the interest
incurred on borrowed capital up to the date of completion is capitalized as part of the cost of acquisition or construction in accordance with ias 23 (Borrowing Costs).

247

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Costs for regular, comprehensive maintenance work (such as the major overhaul of a technical facility) are capitalized as a separate component if they satisfy the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over an asset‚Äôs useful life, except where
depreciation based on actual depletion is more appropriate.
The following depreciation periods are applied throughout the Group:

Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment

[Table 4.9]

Buildings

20 to 50 years

Outdoor infrastructure

10 to 20 years

Storage tanks and pipelines

10 to 20 years

Plant installations

6 to 20 years

Machinery and equipment

6 to 12 years

Furniture and fixtures

4 to 10 years

Vehicles

5 to 8 years

Computer equipment

3 to 5 years

Laboratory and research facilities

3 to 5 years

Significant asset components with different useful lives are accounted for and depreciated separately.
If there are indications that an individual item of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, the recoverable
amount is compared to the carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. If the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer
apply, the impairment loss is reversed provided that the reversal does not cause the carrying amount to exceed the
cost of acquisition or construction less depreciation.
When assets are sold, closed down or scrapped, the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying
amount of the assets is recognized as a gain or loss in other operating income or expenses, respectively.
Investment property comprises land and buildings not being used for operational or administrative purposes. It is
measured using the cost model. The fair value of the investment property reported in the Notes is determined
using the discounted cash flow method, comparisons with the current market values of similar properties, or reports from external experts.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
and derivatives with positive fair values.
They are recognized and measured in accordance with ias 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). Accordingly, financial assets are recognized in the consolidated financial statements if the Bayer Group has
a contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets from another entity. Regular-way purchases and sales of
financial assets are generally posted on the settlement date. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value
plus transaction costs. The transaction costs incurred for the purchase of financial assets held at fair value through
profit or loss are expensed immediately. Interest-free or low-interest receivables are initially reflected at the present
value of the expected future cash flows. Upon first-time recognition, each financial asset is assigned to one of the
categories prescribed in ias 39. Subsequent measurement takes place according to the measurement rules for the
respective category. The measurement rules for each category are set forth below:

248

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss comprise those financial assets that are held for trading.
Receivables from forward commodity contracts and receivables from other derivatives that are included in other
financial assets are allocated to this category, except where hedge accounting is used. Changes in the fair value of
financial assets in this category are recognized in profit or loss when the increase or decrease in fair value occurs.
Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They are accounted for at amortized cost using the effective interest method. This category comprises trade accounts receivable, the loans and receivables included in other financial assets, the additional financial receivables reflected in other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. Interest income from items assigned
to this category is determined using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are nonderivative financial assets, with fixed or determinable payments, that the
Bayer Group is willing and able to hold until maturity. They are accounted for at amortized cost using the effective
interest method. Held-to-maturity financial investments are recognized in other financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those nonderivative financial assets that are not assigned to any of the above
categories. They mainly include equity instruments (such as shares), debt instruments with indefinite maturities,
and debt instruments not to be held to maturity that are included in other financial assets. After their first-time
recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any unrealized gains or losses are
recognized outside profit or loss in equity. These are only reclassified to profit or loss if the assets are sold or if
there are objective indications of impairment, in which case the accumulated loss is recognized in profit or loss. An
objective indication of impairment is a significant or prolonged decrease in the fair value of an equity instrument to
below its acquisition cost. Previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for them no longer
apply. Impairment loss reversals for equity instruments are recognized outside profit or loss, while those for debt
instruments are recognized in profit or loss. Where possible, a fair value for equity and debt securities is derived
from market data. Financial assets for which no market price is available and whose fair value cannot be reasonably
estimated are recognized at cost less any impairment losses.
If there are substantial and objective indications of a decline in the value of loans and receivables, held-to-maturity
financial assets or available-for-sale financial assets, an impairment test is performed. Indications of possible impairment include a high probability of insolvency, a significant deterioration in credit standing, a material breach of
contract, operating losses reported by a company over several years, a reduction in market value, the financial
restructuring of the debtor, or the disappearance of an active market for the asset.
In the case of loans and receivables, and held-to-maturity financial assets, an impairment test is performed in
which the carrying amount is compared to the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the
original effective interest rate. If the carrying amount exceeds the present value, an impairment loss is recognized
for the difference between the two amounts. If the reasons for previously recognized impairment losses no longer
apply, the impairment losses are reversed provided that this does not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the
amortized cost of acquisition.

249

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Financial assets are derecognized when contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire or
the financial assets are transferred together with all material risks and benefits.
INVENTORIES
In accordance with ias 2 (Inventories), inventories encompass assets consumed in production or in the rendering
of services (raw materials and supplies), assets in the production process for sale (work in process), goods held for
sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods and goods purchased for resale), and advance payments on
inventories. Inventories are recognized at their cost of acquisition or production ‚Äì calculated by the weightedaverage method ‚Äì or at their net realizable value, whichever is lower. The net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost to complete and selling expenses.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, checks received, and balances with banks and companies. Cash equivalents are highly liquid short-term financial investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value,
are easily convertible into a known amount of cash and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of
acquisition or investment.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Assets held for sale comprise noncurrent assets or disposal groups (together with any liabilities), the carrying
amounts of which will be realized principally through a highly probable sale transaction within the next twelve
months or an already contractually agreed sale transaction, and not through continued use. At the time of their
classification as ‚Äúheld for sale,‚Äù such assets are collectively measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair
value less costs of disposal, and depreciation or amortization ceases.
Groups of assets held for sale that represent a standalone business and correspond to at least one strategic business entity are combined in the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial
position and statement of cash flows and reported under assets held for sale or discontinued operations.
PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Within the Bayer Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and / or defined benefit
plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the
company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year in which
they are due and as such are included in the functional cost items, and thus in ebit. All other post-employment
benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e. financed by provisions, or funded, i.e.
financed through pension funds.
The present value of provisions for defined benefit plans and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance
with ias 19 (Employee Benefits) by the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by
actuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding
beneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and
pension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.
The discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific currencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The uniform
discount rate derived from this interest-rate structure is thus based on the yields, at the closing date, of a portfolio
of ‚Äúaa‚Äù rated corporate bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.

250

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and
other post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. The obligations and plan assets are
valued at regular intervals of not more than three years. Comprehensive actuarial valuations for all major plans are
performed annually as of December 31. Plan assets in excess of the benefit obligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in ias 19 (Employee Benefits).
The balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net liability,
is recognized in ebit. The net interest is reflected in the financial result under other financial income and expenses.
The effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in the statement of comprehensive
income as other comprehensive income. They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets and
changes in the effects of the asset ceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest. Deferred taxes
relating to the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.
OTHER PROVISIONS
Other provisions are recognized for present legal and constructive obligations arising from past events that will
probably give rise to a future outflow of resources, provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligations.
Other provisions are measured in accordance with ias 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets)
or, where applicable, ias 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is expected to
occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow. Claims for reimbursements from third parties are separately reflected in other receivables if their realization is virtually certain.
If the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the corresponding amount and the resulting income recognized in the operating expense item(s) in which the original
charge was recognized.
To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Group are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in the
underlying parameters. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed events actually occurring, the
impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is examined in each case. This analysis
has not shown other provisions to be materially sensitive.
Complex tax regulations may give rise to uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and the amount and
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term
nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate adjustments to tax income and expense in future periods. The Group establishes provisions for taxes, based on reasonable estimates, for liabilities
to the tax authorities of the respective countries that are uncertain as to their amount and the probability of their
occurrence. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits
and differing legal interpretations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Provisions for environmental protection are recorded if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to ensure
compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work, such costs can be reliably estimated
and no future benefits are expected from such measures.

251

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Estimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly
with regard to the status of laws, regulations and the information available about conditions in the various countries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in similar
cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained regarding the Group‚Äôs environmental programs, current costs
and new developments affecting costs, management‚Äôs interpretation of current environmental laws and regulations,
the number and financial position of third parties that may become obligated to participate in any remediation
costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely to be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.
Taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, provisions are believed to be adequate based upon currently available information. Given the difficulties inherent in
estimating liabilities in the businesses in which the Group operates, especially those for which the risk of environmental damage is greater in relative terms (CropScience and Covestro), it remains possible that material additional
costs will be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are necessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be reasonably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring only cover expenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for
restructuring and are not related to future business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to
employees and compensation payments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used.
Restructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of business
activities or fundamental reorganizations of business units.
The respective provisions are established when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved upon by
the responsible decision-making level of management and communicated to the employees and / or their representatives. Provisions for restructuring are established at the present value of future disbursements.
Trade-related provisions are recorded mainly for the granting of rebates or discounts, product returns, or obligations in respect of services already received but not yet invoiced.
As a global enterprise with a diverse business portfolio, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for
which provisions for litigations must be established under certain conditions ‚Äì particularly in the areas of product
liability, competition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law and environmental protection.
Litigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in
which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future proceedings generally cannot be predicted. It is particularly difficult to assess the likely outcomes of class actions for
damages in the United States, which may give rise to significant financial risks for the Bayer Group. As a result of a
judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions or the conclusion of a settlement, the Bayer Group may incur
charges for which no accounting measures have yet been taken for lack of reasonable estimability or which exceed
presently established provisions and the insurance coverage.
The Bayer Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and the
extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its legal department and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Bayer Group.

252

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Where it is more likely than not that such a litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably
estimable, a provision for litigation is recorded in the amount of the present value of the expected cash outflows.
Such provisions cover the estimated payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural costs, attorney costs and the
cost of potential settlements.
It is frequently impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the
probability that a potential outflow of resources will result from a pending or future litigation. The status of the
material ‚Äúlegal risks‚Äù is described in note [32]. Due to the special nature of these litigations, provisions generally
are not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of potential amounts or judgments have been issued.
Provisions for legal defense costs are established if it is probable that material costs will have to be incurred for
external legal counsel to defend the company‚Äôs legal position.
Internal and external legal counsel evaluate the current status of the Bayer Group‚Äôs material legal risks at the end
of each reporting period. The need to establish or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or adjustment
are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The measurement of provisions in the case of class actions or mass compensation claims is mainly
based on any settlements reached during the past year and on pending or anticipated future claims.
Personnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for annual bonus payments, variable one-time payments,
individual performance awards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement
arrangements, surpluses on long-term accounts and other personnel costs. Obligations under stock-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also included here.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.
Primary financial liabilities are initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value if the
Bayer Group has a contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets to another party. In subsequent
periods, such liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Liabilities for contingent consideration arising from business combinations are measured at fair value. Changes in
fair value are recognized through profit or loss as of the respective closing date.
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.
OTHER RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES
Accrued items and other nonfinancial assets and liabilities are carried at amortized cost. They are amortized to
income by the straight-line method or according to performance of the underlying transaction.
Grants and subsidies from third parties that serve to promote investment are reflected in the statement of financial
position under other liabilities and amortized to income over the useful lives of the respective investments or in line
with the terms of the grant or subsidy.
DERIVATIVES
The Bayer Group uses derivatives ‚Äì such as forward exchange contracts and interest-rate swaps ‚Äì to mitigate the
risk of changes in exchange rates, interest rates or prices. Derivatives are recognized at the trade date.
Contracts concluded in order to receive or deliver nonfinancial goods for the company‚Äôs own purposes are not
accounted for as derivatives but treated as pending transactions. Where embedded derivatives are identified that
are required to be separated from the pending transactions, they are accounted for separately. To take advantage of
market opportunities or cover possible peak demand, a nonmaterial volume of transactions may be entered into for
which the possibility of immediate resale cannot be excluded. Such transactions are allocated to separate portfolios
upon acquisition and accounted for as derivatives according to ias 39.

253

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Derivatives are carried at fair value. Positive fair values at the end of the reporting period are reflected in financial
assets, negative fair values in financial liabilities. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized
directly in profit or loss except where hedge accounting is used. Changes in the fair values of forward exchange
contracts and currency options serving as hedges of items in the statement of financial position are reflected in
other financial income and expenses as exchange gains or losses, while changes in the values of interest-rate
swaps and interest-rate options are recognized in interest income or expense. Changes in the fair values of commodity futures and options, and of forward exchange contracts used to hedge forecasted transactions in foreign
currencies, are recognized in other operating income or expenses.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges and the adjustments in the carrying
amounts of the underlying transactions are recognized in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair values of the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recognized outside profit or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. They are reclassified to profit or loss
when the underlying transaction is realized. If such a derivative is sold or ceases to qualify for hedge accounting,
the change in its value continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted
transaction is realized. If the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the amount previously recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income has to be reclassified to profit or loss. The ineffective portion of gains or
losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognized either in other operating income or expenses or
in the financial result, depending on the type of underlying transaction.
The income and expense reflected in the financial result pertaining to the derivatives and the underlying transactions are shown separately. Income and expense are not offset.
LEASES
A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor assigns to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of
time in return for a payment or series of payments. Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases.
Lease transactions that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to
the lessee are treated as finance leases. All other lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Whether an
agreement constitutes a lease or contains a lease is determined upon inception of the lease.
Where the Bayer Group is the lessee in a finance lease, the leased asset is capitalized at the lower of the fair value
of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term and simultaneously recognized under financial liabilities. The minimum lease payments are divided into the principal portion
of the remaining obligation and the financing costs, which are determined using the effective-interest method. The
leased asset is depreciated by the straight-line method over the shorter of its estimated useful life or the lease term.
Where the Bayer Group is the lessee in an operating lease, the lease payments are expensed. Where it is the lessor,
the lease payments received are recognized in profit or loss. The leased asset continues to be recognized under
property, plant and equipment in the Bayer Group‚Äôs statement of financial position.
ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING
Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method, which requires that the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date Bayer obtains control. Ancillary acquisition costs are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they occur.

254

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed
at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used in
calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group‚Äôs future results of operations. In particular, the estimation of discounted cash flows from intangible assets under development, patented and nonpatented technologies
and brands is based on assumptions concerning, for example:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

the outcomes of research and development activities regarding compound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.,
the probability of obtaining regulatory approvals in individual countries,
long-term sales trends,
possible selling price erosion due to generic competition in the market following patent expirations,
the behavior of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.).

For significant acquisitions, the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent thirdparty valuation specialists. The valuations are based on the information available at the acquisition date.
In step acquisitions, the fair values of the acquired entity‚Äôs assets and liabilities are measured in accordance with
ifrs 3 (Business Combinations) at the date on which control is obtained. Any resulting adjustments to the fair value
of the existing interest are recognized in profit or loss. The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities already
recognized in the statement of financial position is then adjusted accordingly.
PROCEDURE USED IN GLOBAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND ITS IMPACT
Impairment tests are performed not only on individual items of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment,
but also at the level of cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. A cash-generating unit is the
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets. The Bayer Group regards its strategic business entities or groups of strategic
business entities, as well as certain product families, as cash-generating units and subjects them to global impairment testing. The strategic business entities constitute the second financial reporting level below the segments.
Cash-generating units and unit groups are globally tested if there is an indication of possible impairment. Those to
which goodwill is allocated are tested at least annually.
Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit, unit group or item of
intangible assets, property, plant or equipment to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less
costs of disposal or value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss must
be recognized for the difference. If a strategic business entity or entity group is found to be impaired, an impairment loss is first recognized on any goodwill allocated to it. Any remaining part of the impairment loss is then
allocated among the other noncurrent nonfinancial assets of the strategic business entity or entity group in proportion to their carrying amounts. The resulting expense is reflected in the functional item of the income statement in
which the depreciation or amortization of the respective assets is recognized. The same applies to income from
impairment loss reversals.

255

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal, taking into
account the present value of the future net cash flows as market prices for the individual units are not normally
available. These are forecasted on the basis of the Bayer Group‚Äôs current planning, the planning horizon normally
being three to five years. Forecasting involves making assumptions, especially regarding future selling prices, sales
volumes, costs, market growth rates, economic cycles and exchange rates. These assumptions are based on internal estimates along with external market studies. Where the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs of disposal, the cash-generating unit or unit group is measured from the viewpoint of an independent market participant.
Where the recoverable amount is the value in use, the cash-generating unit, unit group or individual asset is measured as currently used. In either case, net cash flows beyond the planning period are determined on the basis of
long-term business expectations using the respective individual growth rates derived from market information. The
fair value less costs of disposal is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt capital. To
allow for the different risk and return profiles of the Bayer Group‚Äôs principal businesses, the after-tax cost of capital
is calculated separately for each subgroup and a subgroup-specific capital structure is defined by benchmarking
against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds to the return expected
by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which comparable companies can obtain longterm financing. Both components are derived from capital market information.
The growth rates applied for impairment testing in 2015 and 2014 and the capital cost factors used to discount the
expected cash flows are shown in the following table:

No impairment losses were recognized on goodwill on the basis of the global annual impairment testing of the
cash-generating units and unit groups in 2015 or 2014. In 2014, a ‚Ç¨6 million impairment loss was recognized on a
goodwill item following an impairment test performed in connection with a divestiture. Impairment losses on
goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment ‚Äì net of ‚Ç¨1 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2 million) in impairment loss reversals ‚Äì totaled ‚Ç¨229 million (2014: ‚Ç¨223 million). Details are provided in notes [17] and [18].

256

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Although the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets, assumptions concerning the macroeconomic environment and developments in the industries in which the Bayer Group operates, and estimates of the discounted future cash flows are believed to be appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances could require changes in
the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment losses in the future or ‚Äì except in the case of goodwill ‚Äì to
reversals of previously recognized impairment losses if developments are contrary to expectations.
The sensitivity analysis for cash-generating units and unit groups to which goodwill is allocated was based on a
10% reduction in future cash flows, a 10% increase in the weighted average cost of capital or a one-percentagepoint reduction in the long-term growth rate. Bayer concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any cash-generating unit or unit group under these conditions.

5. Segment reporting
At Bayer the Board of Management, as the chief operating decision maker, allocates resources to the operating
segments and assesses their performance. The reportable segments and regions are identified, and the disclosures
selected, in line with the internal financial reporting system (management approach) and based on the Group
accounting policies outlined in note [4].
As of December 31, 2015, the Bayer Group comprised three subgroups, with operations subdivided into strategic
business entities known as divisions (HealthCare), business groups (CropScience) or business units (Covestro;
formerly MaterialScience). Their activities were aggregated into four reportable segments according to economic
characteristics, products, production processes, customer relationships, methods of distribution and regulatory
environment.
The segments‚Äô activities were as follows:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Business activities that cannot be allocated to any other segment are reported under ‚ÄúAll other segments.‚Äù These
primarily include the services provided by the service areas: Business Services, Technology Services and Currenta.
The items in ‚ÄúCorporate Center and Consolidation‚Äù comprise the activities of the Bayer holding companies, the
increase or decrease in expenses for Group-wide long-term stock-based compensation arising from fluctuations in
the performance of Bayer stock, and the consolidation of intersegment sales (2015: ‚Ç¨2.4 billion; 2014: ‚Ç¨2.5 billion).
The reconciliation in the table ‚ÄúKey Data by Region‚Äù eliminates interregional items and transactions and reflects
income, expenses, assets and liabilities not allocable to geographical areas, particularly those relating to the Corporate Center.
The segment data are calculated as follows:
‚Ä¢ The intersegment sales reflect intra-Group transactions effected at transfer prices fixed on an arm‚Äôs-length basis.
‚Ä¢ ebit ‚Äì income after income taxes, plus income taxes, plus financial result ‚Äì which is not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards, is influenced by one-time special effects and by the amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, along with impairment losses and impairment
loss reversals. To elucidate the effects of these parameters on the operational business and facilitate the comparability of operational earning power over time, we determine additional indicators: ebitda, ebit before special
items, ebitda before special items and the ebitda margin before special items. These indicators also are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards. ebitda (ebit plus the amortization of intangible assets
and the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, plus impairment losses, minus impairment loss reversals, recognized in profit or loss in the reporting period) serves to characterize the operational business irrespective of the effects of amortization, depreciation or impairment losses / impairment loss reversals. ebit before
special items and ebitda before special items show the development of the operational business irrespective of
the effects of special items ‚Äì those that are nonrecurring or do not regularly recur or attain similar magnitudes.
ebit before special items and ebitda before special items are determined by adding special charges and subtracting special gains. They constitute relevant key data for Bayer. The ebitda margin before special items,
which is calculated by dividing ebitda before special items by sales, serves as an indicator of relative operational earning power for purposes of internal and external comparison.
‚Ä¢ The gross cash flow comprises income after income taxes, plus income taxes, plus financial result, minus income taxes paid or accrued, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment losses, minus impairment loss reversals, plus / minus changes in pension provisions, minus gains / plus losses on retirements of noncurrent assets,
minus gains from the remeasurement of already held assets in step acquisitions. The change in pension provisions includes the elimination of noncash components of ebit. It also contains benefit payments during the year.
Gross cash flow is not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards.
‚Ä¢ The net cash flow is the cash flow from operating activities as defined in ias 7 (Statement of Cash Flows).
‚Ä¢ The capital invested and the segment assets include all assets serving the respective segment that are required
to yield a return on their cost of acquisition. Segment assets include, in addition, assets held for sale where the
return is covered by the sale proceeds. Similarly, the segment liabilities include the liabilities directly related to
assets held for sale. Also included in the capital invested and in segment assets are material participating interests of direct relevance to business operations. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included
in the capital invested at cost of acquisition, generation or construction throughout their useful lives. Interestfree liabilities are deducted from the capital invested, which is stated as of December 31.
‚Ä¢ The cfroi ‚Äì a measure of the return on the capital employed ‚Äì is the difference between the gross cash flow and
the cost of reproducing depletable assets, divided by the average capital invested for the year.
‚Ä¢ The equity items reflect the earnings and carrying amounts of companies accounted for using the equity method.
‚Ä¢ Since the financial management of Group companies is carried out centrally by Bayer AG, financial liabilities are
not directly allocated among the segments. Consequently, the liabilities shown for the individual segments do
not include financial liabilities. These are included in the reconciliation.
‚Ä¢ The number of employees on either permanent or temporary contracts is stated in full-time equivalents (fte),
with part-time employees included on a pro-rated basis in line with their contractual working hours. The figures
do not include apprentices.

INFORMATION ON MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Revenues from transactions with a single customer in no case exceeded 10% of Bayer Group sales in 2015
or 2014.
SEGMENT REPORTING EFFECTIVE 2016
In September 2015, it was decided to introduce a new organizational structure effective January 1, 2016, in line
with Bayer‚Äôs focus on the Life Science businesses. The former Bayer HealthCare subgroup has now been dissolved
and the Radiology business assigned to the Pharmaceuticals Division. The Consumer Health Division now consists
entirely of the Consumer Care business. Animal Health has become a reportable segment. The Bayer CropScience
subgroup is now the Crop Science Division.
The segments‚Äô activities are as follows:

The increase in the total number of consolidated companies in 2015 was primarily due to changes in the scope of
consolidation and to acquisitions. Derecognitions were primarily due to mergers among Group companies.
Bayer Pearl Polyurethane Systems llc, United Arab Emirates, is fully consolidated because the Bayer Group holds
a majority of the voting rights.

The above table includes one joint operation, LyondellBasell Covestro Manufacturing Maasvlakte v.o.f., Netherlands, as of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. Pursuant to ifrs 11, Bayer‚Äôs share of this company‚Äôs
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
Bayer‚Äôs rights and obligations. The main purpose of LyondellBasell Covestro Manufacturing Maasvlakte v.o.f. is the
joint production of propylene oxide (po) for Bayer and its partner Lyondell.
In conjunction with the acquisition of the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States, Bayer entered into a strategic collaboration with that company. This collaboration is included in the consolidated financial
statements as a joint operation. Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc., have mutually agreed to collaborate on the development, production, life-cycle management and marketing of active ingredients and products in the field of soluble
guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation.
Four (2014: three) associates and three (2014: three) joint ventures were accounted for in the consolidated financial
statements using the equity method. Details of these companies are given in note [19].
Flagship Ventures V Agricultural Fund, l.p., United States, was included in the consolidated financial statements for
the first time in 2015 and classified as an associate. Bayer has no control over this associate despite owning 99.9%
of the capital, but is able to significantly influence its financial and operating policy decisions.
Nanjing Baijingyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China, was classified as an associate in view of Bayer‚Äôs representation
on its executive committee and supervisory board. This enables Bayer to significantly influence its financial and
operating policy decisions despite owning only 15% of its voting rights and capital.

6.2 Business combinations and other acquisitions
ACQUISITIONS IN 2015
The purchase prices for the acquisitions made in 2015, along with adjustments to purchase prices and purchase
price allocations effected in 2015 relating to previous years‚Äô transactions, totaled ‚Ç¨8 million (2014: ‚Ç¨13,741 million). The purchase prices of the acquired companies or businesses were settled mainly in cash. Adjustments to
purchase price allocations and other adjustments reduced the total carrying amount of goodwill by ‚Ç¨5 million
(2014: ‚Ç¨5,169 million increase). The changes in goodwill mainly resulted from the following transactions:
On March 2, 2015, Covestro successfully completed the acquisition of all the shares of Thermoplast Composite
GmbH, Germany, a technology leader specializing in the production of thermoplastic fiber composites. The aim of
the acquisition is to expand the range of polycarbonate materials for major industries to include composites made
from continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastics. A purchase price of ‚Ç¨18 million was agreed. This includes a variable component of ‚Ç¨4 million. The purchase price mainly pertained to patents and goodwill.
On July 1, 2015, CropScience completed the acquisition of all the shares of SeedWorks India Pvt. Ltd., based in
Hyderabad, India. The company is specialized in the breeding, production and marketing of hybrid seeds of tomato, hot pepper, okra and gourds. It has research and seed processing locations in Bangalore and Hyderabad, respectively. The purchase of SeedWorks India is intended to further strengthen CropScience‚Äôs vegetable seed business in India. A purchase price of ‚Ç¨80 million was agreed, subject to the usual purchase price adjustments. The
purchase price mainly pertained to patents, research and development projects and goodwill.
As part of the acquisition of the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey,
United States, the production facilities at the Pointe-Claire site in Canada were acquired on July 1, 2015. A purchase price of ‚Ç¨67 million was agreed.
The global purchase price allocation for the consumer care business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc. in 2014 was
completed in September 2015.

264

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

This resulted in an adjustment to deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
intangible assets in the ifrs financial statements and those reported for tax purposes, along with a corresponding
decline in goodwill in the statement of financial position. These deferred tax assets were retroactively restated to
the date of acquisition pursuant to ifrs 3.45ff.

In addition, the purchase price was reduced by ‚Ç¨8 million in 2015 on the basis of agreed purchase price adjustment
mechanisms.
The court proceedings initiated by former minority stockholders of Bayer Pharma AG (formerly Bayer Schering
Pharma AG), Berlin, Germany, were settled in August 2015. The additional payment made as a result represents a
subsequent purchase price adjustment according to the March 31, 2004, version of ifrs 3 in effect at the acquisition date. The goodwill was increased by ‚Ç¨261 million in 2013 based on the status of the proceedings at that time.
The settlements made it possible to finally determine the goodwill arising from the acquisition. It was therefore
necessary to reduce the goodwill amount by ‚Ç¨115 million in 2015 as a result of the proceedings. Both the increase
and the reduction were recognized outside profit or loss against the liability resulting from the minority stockholders‚Äô compensation claim.
The global purchase price allocation for Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., Kunming, Yunnan, China, acquired
in 2014, was completed in October 2015. The purchase price was reduced by ‚Ç¨43 million in 2015 due to adjustment mechanisms.
The purchase price allocations for SeedWorks India Pvt. Ltd. and the production facilities at the Pointe-Claire site
in Canada acquired from Merck & Co., Inc. currently remain incomplete pending compilation and review of the
relevant financial information. It is therefore possible that changes will be made in the allocation of the purchase
prices to the individual assets and liabilities.
The businesses of the above-mentioned acquired companies Thermoplast Composite GmbH and SeedWorks
India Pvt. Ltd. contributed a total of ‚Ç¨5 million to Bayer Group sales in 2015. ebit of these businesses in 2015 totaled minus ‚Ç¨5 million. Their total income after taxes since the respective dates of their first-time consolidation was
minus ‚Ç¨5 million. This includes the financing costs incurred since the respective acquisition dates.
If the above acquisitions had already been made as of January 1, 2015, the Bayer Group would have had total
sales of ‚Ç¨46,334 million in 2015. Group income after taxes and earnings per share would not have been materially
affected.

ACQUISITIONS IN 2014
In 2014, the following acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with ifrs 3:
On March 6, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of all the shares of Biagro Group, a producer and distributor of biological seed treatment solutions headquartered in General Las Heras in the province of Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The company operates production facilities in Argentina and Brazil. Its portfolio of established brands
includes seed-applied inoculants, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms and other products for integrated pest
management based on bacterial and fungal strains. The acquisition helps CropScience to build on the success of its
soybean seed business in Latin America. A one-time payment and purchase price adjustment totaling ‚Ç¨10 million
were agreed upon along with potential milestone payments reflected at ‚Ç¨6 million in the purchase price allocation.
The milestone payments are mainly dependent on the achievement of certain sales targets and product approvals.
The purchase price mainly pertained to the technology platform and goodwill.
In March 2014, HealthCare successfully completed the takeover offer for the shares of Algeta asa, Oslo, Norway,
and acquired 100% of the outstanding shares. Bayer issued a takeover offer for all the shares of Algeta at a price of
nok 362 per share in cash on January 20, 2014. On expiration of the offer deadline, Bayer had received acceptances from Algeta shareholders representing about 98% of the share capital. On March 14, 2014, a compulsory acquisition process was carried out to obtain the remaining 2% of the shares, also at a price of nok 362 per share.
Algeta creates novel cancer therapies based on its world-leading, patented technologies. The company develops
alpha-pharmaceuticals designed to target cancers using the unique properties of alpha particle radiation.
HealthCare and Algeta began collaborating in 2009 to develop and commercialize radium-223 dichloride, which
was approved in the United States in May 2013 under the tradename Xofigo‚Ñ¢. The acquisition strengthened the
oncology business of Pharmaceuticals. The purchase price was ‚Ç¨1,974 million, including ‚Ç¨35 million for the settlement of the pre-existing relationship between Algeta and Bayer. The latter amount represented the value of the
advantage enjoyed by the acquirer from the contractual relationship that existed prior to the acquisition compared
to market conditions for similar collaborations. The settlement amount was reflected in other operating income and
at the same time increased the consideration transferred.
The purchase price mainly pertained to an intangible asset for the product-specific radium-223 technology along
with goodwill. The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies in administration processes and infrastructure,
including cost savings in the selling, research and development, and general administration functions.
On September 30, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of the seeds business of Granar s.a., headquartered in Encarnaci√≥n, Paraguay. Granar specializes in the breeding, production and marketing of improved seed,
especially soybean seed, that is adapted to the growing conditions in subtropical regions. It has a strong presence
in Paraguay and Uruguay and an increasing presence in Brazil. Granar continued to sell the seed for its own account for the 2014 / 15 sowing season. Bayer took over marketing in 2015. Part of the agreed one-time payment of
‚Ç¨15 million to acquire the business has been retained for disbursement over the next six years and is reflected at
‚Ç¨2 million in the purchase price allocation.
On October 1, 2014, HealthCare completed the acquisition of the consumer care business of u.s. company Merck &
Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. The acquired business is primarily comprised of products in the cold,
allergy, sinus & flu, dermatology (including sun care), foot health and gastrointestinal categories. The most important brands are Claritin‚Ñ¢ (allergy), Coppertone‚Ñ¢ (sun care), Mira‚Ñ¢ (gastrointestinal) and Afrin‚Ñ¢ (cold), and ‚Äì
in North America and Latin America ‚Äì Dr. Scholl‚Äôs‚Ñ¢ (foot health). These products complement Bayer‚Äôs existing
range of nonprescription medicines.

267

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In those countries where the consumer care business was acquired via an asset deal, Merck & Co., Inc. continued
the sales activities in its own name for a transitional period until the marketing authorizations had been transferred
to Bayer or Bayer was able to take over the business as distributor. During this period, the economic rewards and
risks already accrued to Bayer, and Bayer received the operating profit on the business from Merck. The transitional period has ended.
Where the business was acquired via a share deal, Bayer purchased 100% of the respective company‚Äôs shares.
In 2014, Bayer paid a provisional purchase price of ‚Ç¨11,177 million, less specific amounts that were retained pending the receipt of antitrust approvals in the Republic of Korea and the transfer of further assets. The provisional
purchase price allocation mainly comprised goodwill of ‚Ç¨5,137 million and acquired trademarks valued at
‚Ç¨5,362 million. The goodwill amount was retroactively adjusted to ‚Ç¨4,316 million as of the acquisition date. It is
largely based on cost synergies, especially in marketing and manufacturing, as well as on sales synergies resulting
from the increased distribution capability and use of the global infrastructure. As expected, a goodwill amount of
‚Ç¨2,084 million is tax-deductible.
Upon closure of this acquisition, the strategic pharmaceutical collaboration agreed between Bayer and Merck &
Co., Inc. in the field of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation also came into effect. Bayer‚Äôs aim in entering
into the global co-development and co-commercialization agreement, which has already received antitrust clearance, is to strengthen its development potential in the cardiovascular therapeutic area. In this connection, Merck &
Co., Inc. is to make payments to Bayer of up to us$2.1 billion, comprising an up-front payment of us$1.0 billion
(‚Ç¨793 million) made in 2014 and sales milestone payments of up to us$1.1 billion related to future joint activities
with certain compounds, including Adempas‚Ñ¢ (riociguat) to treat pulmonary hypertension. The one-time payment
of ‚Ç¨793 million is to be recognized in sales and earnings over a period of 13.5 years as the obligations are satisfied.
On November 1, 2014, Consumer Health acquired all the shares of Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., Kunming,
Yunnan, China. Dihon is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the manufacture and marketing of over-thecounter (otc) and herbal traditional Chinese medicine products. A provisional purchase price of ‚Ç¨401 million was
accounted for in 2014. This was based on a purchase price adjustment mechanism. The purchase price mainly
pertained to acquired trademarks and goodwill.
On December 1, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of land management assets in the United States,
Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand from E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, United States. The acquisition provides CropScience with access to the growing forestry and range & pasture business segments in
North America. Bayer paid a provisional purchase price of ‚Ç¨120 million in 2014. A potential milestone payment for
a successful registration was agreed upon in addition. This payment was included at ‚Ç¨18 million in the purchase
price allocation. The purchase price mainly pertained to intangible assets for product-related technologies and
goodwill.

DIVESTITURES AND MATERIAL SALE TRANSACTIONS IN 2015
The effects of divestitures and material sale transactions made in 2015 and previous years on the consolidated
financial statements were as follows:
On March 2, 2015, Consumer Health completed the sale of two equine products, Legend / Hyonate and Marquis, to
Merial, Inc., Duluth, Georgia, United States. A purchase price of ‚Ç¨120 million was agreed. The one-time payment is
accounted for as deferred income. The purchase prices for Legend / Hyonate and Marquis will be reflected in sales
and earnings over a four-year and a three-year period, respectively, as Bayer has entered into further significant
obligations.
No assets or liabilities were derecognized in 2015 as a result of this divestiture.

DIVESTITURES AND MATERIAL SALE TRANSACTIONS IN 2014
On August 29, 2014, Consumer Health completed the sale of the Interventional device business to Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, Massachusetts, United States. The sale comprised the AngioJet‚Ñ¢ thrombectomy system
and the Jetstream‚Ñ¢ atherectomy system, as well as the Fetch‚Ñ¢2 aspiration catheter used in cardiology, radiology
and peripheral vascular procedures. The total transaction price, including fees for transitional services to Boston
Scientific and before working capital adjustments, was ‚Ç¨315 million. Disregarding the transitional services, a
special gain of ‚Ç¨80 million was recognized in other operating income, and deferred income of ‚Ç¨2 million was
recognized in liabilities.
On October 1, 2014, the strategic pharmaceutical collaboration agreed between Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc.,
United States, in the area of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation came into effect. Pharmaceuticals and
Merck & Co., Inc. assumed joint control of the sGC modulators business. The collaboration agreement provides for
future net cash flows to be equally shared between Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc. Of the goodwill allocated to the
Pharmaceuticals segment, ‚Ç¨173 million was derecognized through profit or loss as of the date the collaboration
came into effect.

Deferred taxes on remeasurements, recognized outside profit or loss, of the net liability for defined benefit pension
and other post-employment benefits diminished equity by ‚Ç¨430 million (2014: increased equity by ‚Ç¨1,621 million).
Deferred taxes on changes, recognized outside profit or loss, in fair values of available-for-sale financial assets and
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges diminished equity by ‚Ç¨27 million (2014: increased equity by
‚Ç¨55 million). These effects on equity are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
The use of tax loss carryforwards reduced the income taxes paid or accrued in 2015 by ‚Ç¨136 million (2014:
‚Ç¨24 million). The use of tax credits reduced income taxes paid or accrued by ‚Ç¨21 million (2014: ‚Ç¨10 million).
Of the total tax loss carryforwards of ‚Ç¨5,497 million in 2015 (2014: ‚Ç¨4,535 million), an amount of ‚Ç¨1,812 million
(2014: ‚Ç¨1,737 million) is expected to be usable within a reasonable period. The increase in loss carryforwards was
mainly due to losses that newly arose in 2015 and tax reassessments for prior years. Deferred tax assets of
‚Ç¨393 million (2014: ‚Ç¨446 million) were recognized for the amount of loss carryforwards expected to be usable. The
deferred tax assets included an amount of ‚Ç¨0 million (2014: ‚Ç¨39 million) that resulted from purchase price allocations and was recognized outside profit or loss.
The use of ‚Ç¨3,685 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,798 million) of tax loss carryforwards was subject to legal or economic restrictions. Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount. If these tax loss carryforwards
had been fully usable, deferred tax assets of ‚Ç¨322 million (2014: ‚Ç¨138 million) would have been recognized.

Tax credits of ‚Ç¨191 million were recognized in 2015 (2014: ‚Ç¨144 million) as deferred tax assets, including
‚Ç¨0 million (2014: ‚Ç¨0 million) outside profit or loss. The use of ‚Ç¨41 million (2014: ‚Ç¨45 million) of tax credits was
subject to legal or economic restrictions. Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount.

In 2015, subsidiaries that reported losses for 2015 or 2014 recognized net deferred tax assets totaling ‚Ç¨2,455 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,117 million) from temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards. These assets were considered to
be unimpaired because the companies concerned were expected to generate taxable income in the future.
Deferred tax liabilities of ‚Ç¨35 million were recognized in 2015 (2014: ‚Ç¨6 million) for planned dividend payments by
subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities were not recognized for temporary differences on ‚Ç¨12,087 million (2014:
‚Ç¨8,648 million) of retained earnings of subsidiaries because these earnings are to be reinvested for an indefinite
period.
The reported tax expense of ‚Ç¨1,227 million for 2015 (2014: ‚Ç¨1,071 million) differed by ‚Ç¨119 million (2014:
‚Ç¨58 million) from the expected tax expense of ‚Ç¨1,346 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,129 million) that would have resulted from
applying an expected weighted average tax rate to the pre-tax income of the Group. This average rate, derived
from the expected tax rates of the individual Group companies, was 25.7% in 2015 (2014: 25.6%). The effective
tax rate was 23.4% (2014: 24.3%).

The capitalized patents and technologies include an amount pertaining to the active ingredient alemtuzumab
(product name: Lemtrada) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Bayer gave back the worldwide distribution rights
for alemtuzumab to Genzyme Corp., United States, in 2009 and in return received global co-promotion rights and
an entitlement to royalties and revenue-based milestone payments. Genzyme Corp. received marketing approval for
alemtuzumab in Europe in 2013 and in the United States in 2014. Bayer has decided not to exercise its copromotion rights.

In the case of research and development projects, the point in time from which a capitalized asset can be expected
to generate an economic benefit for the company cannot be determined. Such assets are therefore classified as
having an indefinite useful life. Development projects were capitalized at a total amount of ‚Ç¨721 million as of the
end of 2015 (2014: ‚Ç¨729 million).
Another intangible asset classified as having an indefinite useful life is the Bayer Cross, which was reacquired for
the North America region in 1994, having been awarded to the United States and Canada under the reparations
agreements at the end of the First World War. The period for which the Bayer Group will derive an economic benefit from this name cannot be determined as Bayer intends to make continuous use of it. The Bayer Cross is capitalized at ‚Ç¨107 million.
PATENTS
The Bayer Group endeavors to obtain patent protection for its products and technologies in the major markets.

For information concerning the interest in this company see Note [6.1]

In 2000, Bayer acquired the polyols business and parts of the propylene oxide (po) production operations of Lyondell Chemicals with the objective of ensuring access to patented technologies and safeguarding the long-term
supply of po, a starting product for polyurethane. As part of this strategy, a company was established to produce po
(po jv, lp, United States, in which Covestro holds a 39.4% interest). Covestro benefits from fixed long-term supply
quotas / volumes of po from this company‚Äôs production. The two following tables contain summarized data from the
income statements and statements of financial position of the associated company po jv, lp, United States, which is
accounted for using the equity method, and show the respective amounts recognized in the consolidated financial

2014 figures restated

The debt instruments reported as available-for-sale financial assets included capital of ‚Ç¨610 million (2014:
‚Ç¨595 million) provided to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG (Bayer-Pensionskasse) for its effective initial fund, and
jouissance right capital (Genussrechtskapital) of ‚Ç¨153 million (2014: ‚Ç¨150 million), also provided to BayerPensionskasse. Also reported in this category were investments of ‚Ç¨119 million (2014: ‚Ç¨10 million) in money market funds along with German treasury bills in the amount of ‚Ç¨125 million (2014: ‚Ç¨125 million). These treasury bills,

290

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

which were lent to a bank, continue to be recognized as available-for-sale financial assets because the related risks
and rewards remain with Bayer. Upon maturity or redemption of the treasury bills, Bayer is obligated until June
2016 to replace them with German government securities.
The equity instruments reported as available-for-sale financial assets included ‚Ç¨40 million (2014: ‚Ç¨29 million) in
instruments whose fair value could not be determined from a stock exchange or other market price or by discounting reliably determinable future cash flows. These equity instruments were recognized at cost.
In 2015, impairment losses totaling ‚Ç¨1 million (2014: impairment loss reversals totaling ‚Ç¨2 million) on available-forsale financial assets were recognized in profit or loss.
Unimpaired other financial assets of ‚Ç¨5 million (2014: ‚Ç¨8 million) were past due on the closing date.
Further information on the accounting for receivables from derivatives is given in note [30].
Receivables under lease agreements relate to finance leases where Bayer is the lessor and the economic owner
of the leased assets is the lessee. These receivables comprised expected lease payments of ‚Ç¨38 million (2014:
‚Ç¨46 million), including ‚Ç¨31 million (2014: ‚Ç¨37 million) in interest. Of the expected lease payments, ‚Ç¨1 million
(2014: ‚Ç¨1 million) is due within one year, ‚Ç¨2 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2 million) within the following four years and
‚Ç¨35 million (2014: ‚Ç¨43 million) in subsequent years.

The gross carrying amount of individually impaired trade accounts receivable was ‚Ç¨245 million (2014:
‚Ç¨217 million). The impairment losses recognized on these assets totaled ‚Ç¨170 million (2014: ‚Ç¨149 million), resulting in a net carrying amount of ‚Ç¨75 million (2014: ‚Ç¨68 million).
The unimpaired receivables were deemed to be collectible on the basis of established credit management processes and individual assessments of customer risks. Recognized impairment losses included an appropriate allowance
for the default risk as of the end of the reporting period.

Receivables from government health service institutions, especially in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, are under
special observation in view of the government debt crisis. Although there were no material defaults on such
receivables in 2015 or 2014, it is possible that future developments in these countries could result in payment
delays and / or defaults. This could necessitate the recognition of impairment losses due to new occurrences. Trade
accounts receivable from government health service institutions in the above countries at the end of 2015 totaled
‚Ç¨168 million (2014: ‚Ç¨183 million).
An excess-of-loss policy exists for the HealthCare subgroup as part of a global credit insurance program. More than
80% of the receivables of the HealthCare subgroup are insured up to a maximum total annual compensation payment of ‚Ç¨100 million (2014: ‚Ç¨100 million).
A further ‚Ç¨559 million (2014: ‚Ç¨459 million) of receivables was secured by advance payments, letters of credit or
guarantees or by liens on land, buildings or harvest yields.

23. Other receivables
Other receivables, after impairment losses of ‚Ç¨55 million (2014: ‚Ç¨3 million), were comprised as follows:

system. In addition, there was a ‚Ç¨62 million receivable from the Venezuelan exchange control authority reflecting
the right to receive u.s. dollars at a preferential rate. A ‚Ç¨52 million impairment loss was recognized on this receivable.
Of the ‚Ç¨565 million (2014: ‚Ç¨678 million) in financial receivables included in other receivables, ‚Ç¨564 million (2014:

24. Equity
The foremost objectives of our financial management are to help bring about a sustained increase in Bayer‚Äôs value
for the benefit of all stakeholders, and to ensure the Group‚Äôs creditworthiness and liquidity. The pursuit of these
goals means reducing our cost of capital, optimizing our capital structure, improving our financing cash flow and
effectively managing risk.
The rating agencies commissioned by Bayer assess Bayer‚Äôs creditworthiness as follows:

Rating

[Table 4.60]

Long-term rating

Outlook

Short-term rating

Standard & Poor‚Äôs

A-

stable

A-2

Moody‚Äôs

A3

stable

P-2

These investment-grade ratings reflect the company‚Äôs good creditworthiness and ensure access to a broad investor
base. Bayer‚Äôs financial management is partly based on the debt ratios published by rating agencies, which ‚Äì by
somewhat differing methods ‚Äì take into account the cash flows for a given period in relation to debt, for example.
Bayer‚Äôs financial strategy focuses on an ‚Äúa‚Äù category rating and on preserving our financial flexibility. Apart from
utilizing cash inflows from our operating business to reduce net financial debt, we are implementing our financial
strategy by way of vehicles such as the subordinated hybrid bonds issued in July 2014 and April 2015, the authorized and conditional capital amounts created by resolutions of the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting, and a potential
share buyback program. Bayer‚Äôs Articles of Incorporation do not stipulate capital ratios.
The changes in the various components of equity during 2014 and 2015 are shown in the consolidated statements
of changes in equity.
CAPITAL STOCK
The capital stock of Bayer AG on December 31, 2015 amounted to ‚Ç¨2,117 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,117 million), divided
into 826,947,808 (2013: 826,947,808) registered shares, and was fully paid in. Each share confers one voting right.
AUTHORIZED CAPITAL
Authorized capital of ‚Ç¨530 million was approved by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014. It expires
on April 28, 2019. It can be used to increase the capital stock by issuing new no-par registered shares against cash
contributions and / or contributions in kind, but capital increases against contributions in kind may not exceed a
total of ‚Ç¨423 million (Authorized Capital i). Stockholders must normally be granted subscription rights. However,
the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders‚Äô sub-

294

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

scription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise to fractions in the case of capital increases against cash
and / or contributions in kind, and also to the extent necessary to grant the holders of bonds with warrants or conversion rights or obligations issued by the Company or its group companies a right to subscribe for new shares to
the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of their warrants or conversion rights, or performance of
their exercise or conversion obligations. The Board of Management is also authorized, with the consent of the
Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights if the shares are issued in connection with the
admission of shares to a foreign stock exchange and the total interest in the capital stock attributable to the new
shares for which subscription rights are excluded does not exceed 10% of the existing capital stock on the date of
entry of the authorization in the commercial register or, in the event that this amount is lower, 10% of the existing
capital stock on the date of issuance of the new shares. The Board of Management is further authorized, with the
consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights if the capital is increased against
contributions in kind to issue shares either for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in
companies, or other assets, or for the purpose of implementing a scrip dividend, where stockholders are given the
option of contributing their dividend entitlements to the Company (either in whole or in part) as a contribution in
kind against the issuance of new shares out of the Authorized Capital i. The amount of capital stock represented by
shares issued against cash contributions and / or contributions in kind without granting subscription rights to the
stockholders must not exceed a total of 20% of the capital stock that existed on the date the authorized capital was
approved by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting.
Further authorized capital of ‚Ç¨212 million was approved by the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014. It
expires on April 28, 2019. The Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to
increase the capital stock by up to a total of ‚Ç¨212 million by issuing new no-par registered shares against cash
contributions (Authorized Capital ii). Stockholders must normally be granted subscription rights. However, the
Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise to fractions and also if the shares are issued against cash contributions and the total interest in the capital stock attributable to the new shares for which subscription rights are
excluded does not exceed 10% of the existing capital stock on the date of entry of the authorization in the commercial register or, in the event that this amount is lower, 10% of the existing capital stock on the date of issuance
of the new shares, and the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the market price of the already
listed shares of the company of the same class at the time when the issue price is finalized by the Board of Management within the meaning of Section 203, Paragraphs 1 and 2, in conjunction with Section 186, Paragraph 3,
sentence 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act. Any own shares that are sold on or after April 29, 2014, while
excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights pursuant to Section 71, Paragraph 1, No. 8, Sentence 5, in conjunction
with Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act count toward the above 10%
limit. Shares that have been or may be issued to service bonds with warrants or conversion rights or obligations,
where such bonds are issued on or after April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights in analogous application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act also count toward
this limit.
Neither of these authorized capital amounts has been utilized so far.
CONDITIONAL CAPITAL
The Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014 approved the creation of Conditional Capital 2014, again
authorizing a conditional increase of up to ‚Ç¨212 million in the capital stock through the issuance of up to
82,694,750 new no-par registered shares. The conditional capital increase serves to grant registered no-par value
shares to the holders of bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, profit participation certificates, or income bonds
(or combinations of these instruments) (collectively referred to as ‚Äúdebt instruments‚Äù), each with options or conversion rights or obligations, that may be issued up to April 28, 2019, on the basis of the authorization resolved by
the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014, by Bayer AG or a group company of Bayer AG within the
meaning of Section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act in which Bayer AG has a direct or indirect interest in
at least 90 % of the votes and capital. Such new shares are to be issued at the option premium or conversion price
to be determined in accordance with the authorizing resolution referred to above. The authorization to issue such
instruments is limited to a total nominal amount of ‚Ç¨6 billion. In principle, stockholders have a statutory right to be
granted subscription rights to such instruments. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise
to fractions and also to the extent necessary to grant the holders of bonds with warrants or conversion rights or
obligations a right to subscribe for new shares to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of their

295

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

warrants or conversion rights, or performance of their exercise or conversion obligations. Furthermore, the Board
of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to fully exclude stockholders‚Äô subscription rights to debt instruments with options or conversion rights or obligations issued against cash contributions if
the Board of Management, after due consideration, is of the opinion that the issue price of the debt instruments is
not significantly below their hypothetical fair value determined in accordance with accepted methods, and in particular, valuation techniques. This authorization to exclude subscription rights applies to bonds with warrants or
conversion rights or exercise or conversion obligations for shares with a proportionate interest in the capital stock
not exceeding 10% of the total capital stock either at the date when the resolution is adopted or, in the event that
this amount is lower, at the date on which this authorization is exercised. New shares that are issued on or after
April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights in accordance with Sections 203, Paragraphs 1
and 2, in conjunction with Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act as well as
own shares that are sold on or after April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights pursuant to
Section 71, Paragraph 1, Number 8, Sentence 5, in conjunction with Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4, of the
German Stock Corporation Act also count toward this 10% limit.
Absent a further resolution of the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on the exclusion of stockholders‚Äô subscription
rights, the Board of Management will only use the existing authorizations to increase the capital stock out of the
Authorized Capital or the Conditional Capital ‚Äì while excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights ‚Äì up to a total
amount of 20% of the capital stock that existed when the respective resolutions were adopted by the Annual
Stockholders‚Äô Meeting on April 29, 2014. All issuances or sales of shares or of bonds with warrants or conversion
rights or obligations that are effected while excluding stockholders‚Äô subscription rights also count toward this 20%
limit.
ACCUMULATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Accumulated comprehensive income comprises retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.
The retained earnings include prior years‚Äô undistributed income of consolidated companies and all remeasurements of the net liability for defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are recognized
outside profit or loss. The accumulated other comprehensive income comprises exchange differences, the changes
in fair values of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets, and the revaluation surplus. In 2015, an
amount of ‚Ç¨5 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5 million) corresponding to the annual amortization / depreciation of the respective
assets was transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings. The exchange differences included an
amount of minus ‚Ç¨45 million (2014: minus ‚Ç¨28 million) attributable to associates and joint ventures accounted for
using the equity method.
DIVIDEND
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the dividend payment is determined by the distributable profit
reported in the annual financial statements of Bayer AG, which are prepared according to the German Commercial
Code. Retained earnings were diminished by payment of the dividend of ‚Ç¨2.25 per share for 2014. The proposed
dividend for the 2015 fiscal year is ‚Ç¨2.50 per share, which would result in a total dividend payment of ‚Ç¨2,067 million. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by the stockholders at the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting and therefore is not recognized as a liability in the consolidated financial statements.
NONCONTROLLING INTEREST
The former MaterialScience subgroup became a separate economic and legal entity on September 1, 2015, operating under the name Covestro. Following the stock exchange listing of Covestro AG on October 6, 2015, 30.9% of
the shares in the equity of Covestro AG and its subsidiaries are reflected in noncontrolling interest.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The benefit obligations pertained mainly to Germany (71%; 2014: 73%), the United States (15%; 2014: 14%) and
the United Kingdom (7%; 2014: 6%). In Germany, current employees accounted for about 44% (2014: 45%),
retirees or their surviving dependents for about 49% (2014: 47%) and former employees with vested pension
rights for about 7% (2014: 8%) of entitlements under defined benefit plans. In the United States, current employees accounted for about 26% (2014: 26%), retirees or their surviving dependents for about 61% (2014: 61%) and
former employees with vested pension rights for about 13% (2014: 13%) of entitlements under defined benefit
plans.
The changes in the net defined benefit liability in Germany reported as due to changes in the scope of consolidation mainly resulted from employee transfers outside the consolidated group of companies.
The actual return on the assets of defined benefit plans for pensions or other post-employment benefits amounted
to minus ‚Ç¨34 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,691 million) and minus ‚Ç¨3 million (2014: ‚Ç¨51 million), respectively.
The following table shows the defined benefit obligations for pensions and other post-employment benefits along
with the funded status of the funded obligations.

PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Group companies provide retirement benefits for most of their employees, either directly or by contributing to
privately or publicly administered funds. The way these benefits are provided varies according to the legal, fiscal
and economic conditions of each country, the benefits generally being based on employee compensation and years
of service. The obligations relate both to existing retirees‚Äô pensions and to pension entitlements of future retirees.
Bayer has set up funded pension plans for its employees in various countries. The most appropriate investment
strategy is determined for each defined benefit pension plan based on the risk structure of the obligations (especially demographics, the current funded status, the structure of the expected future cash flows, interest sensitivity,
biometric risks etc.), the regulatory environment and the existing level of risk tolerance or risk capacity. A strategic
target investment portfolio is then developed in line with the plan‚Äôs risk structure, taking capital market factors into
consideration. Further determinants are risk diversification, portfolio efficiency and the need for both a countryspecific and a global risk / return profile centered on ensuring the payment of all future benefits. As the capital
investment strategy for each pension plan is developed individually in light of the plan-specific conditions listed
above, the investment strategies for different pension plans may vary considerably. For example, the proportion of
plan assets invested in equities is greater with the non-German pension plans than with the plans domiciled in
Germany. The investment strategies are generally aligned less toward maximizing absolute returns and more toward the reasonable assurance of financing pension commitments over the long term. For plan assets, stress scenarios are simulated and other risk analyses (such as value at risk) undertaken with the aid of risk management
systems.

301

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG (Bayer-Pensionskasse), Leverkusen, Germany, is by far the most significant of the pension plans. It was closed to new members effective January 1, 2005. This legally independent fund is regarded as a
life insurance company and therefore is subject to the German Insurance Supervision Act. The benefit obligations
covered by Bayer-Pensionskasse comprise retirement, surviving dependents‚Äô and disability pensions. It constitutes
a multi-employer plan, to which the active members and their employers contribute. The company contribution is a
certain percentage of the employee contribution. This percentage is the same for all participating employers, including those outside the Bayer Group, and is set by agreement between the plan‚Äôs executive committee and its
supervisory board, acting on a proposal from the responsible actuary. It takes into account the differences between
the actuarial estimates and the actual values for the factors used to determine liabilities and contributions. Bayer
may also adjust the company contribution in agreement with the plan‚Äôs executive committee and its supervisory
board, acting on a proposal from the responsible actuary. The plan‚Äôs liability is governed by Section 1, Paragraph 1,
Sentence 3 of the German Law on the Improvement of Occupational Pensions. This means that if the pension plan
exercises its right under the articles of association to reduce benefits, each participating employer has to make up
the resulting difference. Bayer is not liable for the obligations of participating employers outside the Bayer Group,
even if they cease to participate in the plan.
Pension entitlements for people who joined Bayer in Germany on or after January 1, 2005, are granted via
Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG, Leverkusen. Future pension payments from this plan are based on contributions
and the return on plan assets; a guaranteed interest rate applies.
Another important pension provision vehicle is Bayer Pension Trust e.V. (bpt). This covers further retirement provision arrangements of the Bayer Group, such as deferred compensation, pension obligations previously administered by Schering Altersversorgung Treuhand e.V., and components of other direct commitments. In October 2015,
a total of ‚Ç¨293 million in investments, representing the equivalent of the Covestro group‚Äôs obligations, was transferred from Bayer Pension Trust to another trust fund, which now (partially) covers the respective obligations of
Covestro.
The defined benefit pension plans in the United States have been frozen for some years, and no significant new
entitlements can be earned under these plans. The assets of all the u.s. pension plans are held by a master trust for
reasons of efficiency. The applicable regulatory framework is based on the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (erisa), which includes a statutory 80% minimum funding requirement to avoid benefit reductions. The actuarial risks, such as investment risk, interest-rate risk and longevity risk, remain with the company.
The defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. Plan assets in the u.k. are
administered by independent trustees, who are legally obligated to act solely in the interests of the beneficiaries.
A technical assessment is performed every three years in line with u.k. regulations. This serves as the basis for
developing a plan to cover any potential financing requirements. Here, too, the actuarial risks remain with the
company.
The other post-employment benefit obligations outside Germany mainly comprised health care benefit payments
for retirees in the United States.

The fair value of plan assets in Germany included real estate leased by Group companies, recognized at a fair value
of ‚Ç¨61 million (2014: ‚Ç¨65 million), and Bayer AG shares and bonds held through investment funds, recognized at
their fair value of ‚Ç¨48 million (2014: ‚Ç¨58 million) and ‚Ç¨3 million (2014: ‚Ç¨6 million), respectively. The other plan
assets comprised mortgage loans granted, other receivables and qualified insurance policies.
RISKS
The risks from defined benefit plans arise partly from the defined benefit obligations and partly from the investment in plan assets. The risks lie in the possibility that higher direct pension payments will have to be made to the
beneficiaries and / or that additional contributions will have to be made to plan assets in order to meet current and
future pension obligations.
Demographic / biometric risks
Since a large proportion of the defined benefit obligations comprises lifelong pension payments to retirees or surviving dependents‚Äô pensions, longer claim periods or earlier claims may result in higher benefit obligations, higher
benefit expense and / or higher pension payments than previously anticipated.

303

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Investment risks
If the actual return on plan assets were below the return anticipated on the basis of the discount rate, the net defined benefit liability would increase, assuming there were no changes in other parameters. This could happen as a
result of a drop in share prices, increases in market rates of interest, default of individual debtors or the purchase
of low-risk but low-interest bonds, for example.
Interest-rate risk
A decline in capital market interest rates, especially for high-quality corporate bonds, would increase the defined
benefit obligation. This effect would be at least partially offset by the ensuing increase in the market values of the
debt instruments held.
MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS AND THEIR SENSITIVITIES
The following weighted parameters were used to measure the obligations for pensions and other post-employment
benefits as of December 31 of the respective year:

Discount rate

The data selection criteria used to determine the discount rate in the eurozone were modified at the beginning of
2015. The modification of the data selection criteria diminished provisions by ‚Ç¨1.0 billion. The discount rate obtained by applying the previous data selection criteria would have been lower by 30 basis points as of December
31, 2015. The change in the way the discount rate is determined reduced the net pension expense for the 2015
fiscal year by ‚Ç¨17 million. As before, the underlying bond portfolio consists entirely of high-quality corporate bonds
with a minimum aa or aaa rating. It no longer includes government-guaranteed or covered bonds.
In Germany the Heubeck 2005 G mortality tables were used, in the United States the rp-2014 Combined Healthy
Mortality Tables, and in the United Kingdom 95% of s1nxa. In the United States, adjustments contained in the mp2015 mortality improvement scale were taken into account in 2015. This led to an actuarial gain of approximately
‚Ç¨66 million.

The parameter sensitivities were computed by expert actuaries based on a detailed evaluation similar to that performed to obtain the data presented in Table 4.65. Altering individual parameters by 0.5 percentage points (mortality by 10% per beneficiary) while leaving the other parameters unchanged would have impacted pension and other

Provisions are also set up for the obligations, mainly of u.s. subsidiaries, to provide post-employment benefits in
the form of health care cost payments for retirees. The valuation of health care costs was based on the assumption
that they will increase at a rate of 7.0%, which should gradually decline to 5.0% by 2023 (assumption in 2014:
7.0%, which should gradually decline to 5.0% by 2018). The following table shows the impact on other postemployment benefit obligations and total benefit expense of a one-percentage-point change in the assumed cost

Bayer has currently committed to make deficit contributions for its u.k. pension plans of gbp 21 million in 2016 and
of approximately gbp 16 million annually thereafter through 2019 and expects to make payments of us$50 million

26.1 Other taxes
Provisions for other taxes mainly related to sales tax back-payments and to local taxes in Brazil.

26.2 Environmental protection
Provisions for environmental protection mainly related to the rehabilitation of contaminated land, recultivation of
landfills, and redevelopment and water protection measures.

26.3 Restructuring
Provisions for restructuring included ‚Ç¨180 million (2014: ‚Ç¨126 million) for severance payments and ‚Ç¨126 million
(2014: ‚Ç¨47 million) for other restructuring expenses, which mainly comprised other costs related to the closure of
production facilities.
At HealthCare ‚Äì as part of the Continuous Efficiency Program ‚Äì restructuring was carried out mainly in the areas of
marketing and supply network optimization. A further focus was on the continuing integration of the businesses
acquired the previous year in the Consumer Health segment. Provisions for the above and other restructuring
measures at HealthCare as of December 31, 2015, amounted to ‚Ç¨94 million. Of this amount, severance payments
accounted for ‚Ç¨83 million and other restructuring expenses for ‚Ç¨11 million.
In CropScience, the restructuring initiated in the United States in prior years, involving the closure of several carbamate production facilities and a formulation plant, continued in 2015. At the same time, the provisions were
increased in view of expected future requirements. Provisions for the above and other restructuring measures at
CropScience as of December 31, 2015, amounted to ‚Ç¨99 million, comprising ‚Ç¨34 million for severance payments
and ‚Ç¨65 million for other restructuring expenses.
Restructuring measures at Covestro mainly comprised the closure of the production facilities at Belford Roxo,
Brazil, and an mdi facility at the site in Tarragona, Spain. Both of these plant closures mainly related to the Polyurethanes business unit. Provisions for restructuring at Covestro as of December 31, 2015, amounted to ‚Ç¨105 million,
consisting of ‚Ç¨55 million for severance payments and ‚Ç¨50 million for other restructuring expenses.
Restructuring was carried out in the central functions to increase efficiency. The restructuring provisions associated with these measures as of December 31, 2015, amounted to ‚Ç¨8 million and pertained entirely to severance payments.

26.4 Trade-related commitments
Provisions for trade-related commitments comprised provisions for rebates, discounts and other price adjustments,
product returns, outstanding invoices, pending losses and onerous contracts.

26.5 Litigations
The legal risks currently considered to be material, and their development, are described in note [32].

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

26.6 Personnel commitments
Provisions for personnel commitments mainly include those for variable one-time payments under short-term incentive programs and for stock-based compensation. Also reflected here are commitments for service awards, early
retirements and pre-retirement part-time working arrangements. Provisions for severance payments resulting from
restructuring are reflected in provisions for restructuring.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
Bayer offers stock-based compensation programs collectively to different groups of employees. As required by ifrs
2 (Share-based Payment) for compensation systems involving cash settlement, awards to be made under the stockbased programs are covered by provisions in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of the date
of the financial statements vis-√†-vis the respective employee group. All resulting valuation adjustments are recognized in profit or loss.
The following table shows the changes in provisions for the various programs:

The value of the Aspire tranches that were fully earned at the end of 2015, resulting in payments at the beginning
of 2016, was ‚Ç¨230 million (2014: ‚Ç¨151 million).
The net expense for all stock-based compensation programs in 2015 was ‚Ç¨248 million (2014: ‚Ç¨212 million), including ‚Ç¨6 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5 million) for the BayShare stock participation program and ‚Ç¨8 million (2014: ‚Ç¨10 million) for
grants of virtual Bayer shares.
The fair value of obligations under the standard stock-based compensation programs was calculated using the
Monte Carlo simulation method based on the following key parameters:

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER
SENIOR EXECUTIVES (ASPIRE I)
Since 2005, members of the Board of Management and other senior executives have been entitled to participate in
Aspire i on the condition that they purchase a certain number of Bayer shares ‚Äì determined for each individual
according to specific guidelines ‚Äì and retain them for the full term of the program. A percentage of the executive‚Äôs
annual base salary ‚Äì according to his / her position ‚Äì is defined as a target for variable payments (Aspire target

opportunity). Depending on the performance of Bayer stock, both in absolute terms and relative to the euro stoxx
50 benchmark index during a four-year performance period, participants are granted an award of up to 300% of
their individual Aspire target opportunity. The start and end prices used to determine the amount of the award
are the averages of the official closing prices of Bayer shares over the last 30 stock-exchange trading days of the
respective year. The four-year tranche issued in 2011 expired at the end of 2014, and payment of the maximum
resulting amount (300%) was made at the beginning of 2015.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MIDDLE MANAGEMENT (ASPIRE II)
Also since 2005, other senior managers and middle managers have been offered Aspire ii, which is similar to Aspire i but does not require a personal investment in Bayer shares. This program was extended to further managerial employees in 2012. The amount of the award is based entirely on the absolute performance of Bayer stock over a
four-year period. The maximum award is 250% of each manager‚Äôs Aspire target opportunity. The start and end
prices used to determine the amount of the award are the averages of the official closing prices of Bayer shares
over the last 30 stock-exchange trading days of the respective year. The four-year tranche issued in 2011 expired at
the end of 2014, and payment of the maximum resulting amount (250%) was made at the beginning of 2015.
BAYSHARE 2015
All management levels and nonmanagerial employees are offered an annual stock participation program known as
BayShare, under which Bayer subsidizes their personal investments in the company‚Äôs stock. The discount under
this program is set separately each year. In 2015 it was 20% (2014: 20%) of the subscription amount. Employees
stated a fixed amount that they wished to invest in shares. The maximum subscription amount in Germany was set
at ‚Ç¨2,500 (2014: ‚Ç¨2,500) or ‚Ç¨5,000 (2014: ‚Ç¨5,000), depending on the employee‚Äôs position. The shares thus acquired
must be retained until December 31 of the year following the year of purchase, irrespective of continued employment with the Bayer Group.
In 2015, employees purchased a total of about 208,000 shares (2014: 225,000 shares) under the BayShare program.
SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT FOR COVESTRO EMPLOYEES CONCERNING THE ASPIRE PROGRAMS
The compensation programs described above were modified for Covestro employees in December 2015 in light of
the legal carve-out of the Covestro companies and the subsequent stock exchange listing of Covestro AG.
The arrangement for the 2012 tranches of both Aspire programs was the same as for Bayer employees. Based on
the development of Bayer‚Äôs share price, the maximum award amounts were reached for both programs (Aspire i
and Aspire ii). Payments of 300% and 250%, respectively, were therefore made at the beginning of 2016.
Valuation for the other three current Aspire tranches issued in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, was based on the
average price of Bayer shares on the last 30 trading days of 2015 (‚Ç¨119.17). This price was fixed in advance as the
end price. Thus the amounts of the payments from the three remaining tranches ‚Äì where these were fully vested ‚Äì
were already finally determined at the end of 2015. A payment of at least 100% is guaranteed. This plan amendment gave rise to additional expenses of ‚Ç¨7 million in 2015.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

MULTI-CURRENCY EUROPEAN MEDIUM TERM NOTES PROGRAM
An important means of external financing are the bonds issued under the multi-currency European Medium Term
Notes (emtn) program. The following transactions took place in 2015 and 2014:
In January 2014, Bayer AG issued three tranches of emtn bonds with a total nominal volume of ‚Ç¨2 billion. One of
these tranches had a nominal volume of ‚Ç¨500 million, and the other two had a nominal volume of ‚Ç¨750 million
each. In March 2014, Bayer Nordic se issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of ‚Ç¨500 million. In November
2014, Bayer Capital Corporation b.v. issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of ‚Ç¨500 million.
OTHER BONDS
In October 2014, Bayer u.s. Finance llc issued six tranches of bonds in 144a / Reg S format with a total volume of
us$7,000 million. The six tranches had nominal volumes of us$500 million, us$400 million, us$850 million,
us$2,000 million, us$1,500 million and us$1,750 million.
In October 2015, Bayer Corporation redeemed at maturity the notes with a nominal volume of us$200 million issued in September 1995.
SUBORDINATED BONDS
In April 2015, Bayer AG issued a subordinated hybrid bond with a volume of ‚Ç¨1,300 million, a final maturity of 60
years and a coupon of 2.375%, to be reset every five years starting in 2022 based on the five-year swap rate. Bayer
has the option to redeem the bond for the first time in October 2022. The issue is structured to receive equity credit
of 50% from Moody‚Äôs and Standard & Poor‚Äôs.
In July 2014, Bayer AG issued two subordinated hybrid bonds with a total nominal volume of ‚Ç¨3,250 million. The
first tranche of ‚Ç¨1,750 million has a maturity of 61 years and a coupon of 3.0%. Bayer has an early redemption
option at par for the first time in 2020. The second tranche of ‚Ç¨1,500 million has a maturity of 60 years and a coupon of 3.75%. On this tranche, Bayer has an early redemption option at par for the first time in 2024. From 2020
and 2024, respectively, the coupons will be reset every five years based on the five-year swap rate. Moody‚Äôs and
Standard & Poor‚Äôs treat 50% of these two bonds as equity. They therefore have a more limited effect on the Group‚Äôs
rating-relevant debt indicators than conventional borrowings.
In July 2015, Bayer AG utilized its right to early redeem the 100-year subordinated hybrid bond with a nominal
volume of ‚Ç¨1,300 million issued in July 2005.
Bayer AG guarantees all the bonds issued by subsidiaries.

Deferred income

Total

Deferred income included an upfront payment, originally amounting to us$1 billion, in connection with the strategic pharmaceutical collaboration agreed between Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc., United States, in the field of soluble
guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation. The deferred income is being amortized over a period of 13.5 years as the
obligations are satisfied. The remaining amount deferred at the end of 2015 was ‚Ç¨719 million (2014: ‚Ç¨778 million).
The amount amortized in 2015 was ‚Ç¨59 million (2014: ‚Ç¨15 million).
The deferred income included ‚Ç¨62 million (2014: ‚Ç¨70 million) in grants and subsidies received from governments,
of which ‚Ç¨7 million (2014: ‚Ç¨8 million) was reversed and recognized in profit or loss.
The miscellaneous liabilities included ‚Ç¨125 million (2014: ‚Ç¨204 million) from derivatives.

30. Financial instruments
The system used by the Bayer Group to manage credit risks, liquidity risks and the various types of market risks
(interest-rate, currency and other price risks), together with its objectives, methods and procedures, is outlined in
the Risk Report, which forms part of the Combined Management Report.

30.1 Financial instruments by category
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities for each financial
instrument category and a reconciliation to the corresponding line item in the statements of financial position.
Since the line items ‚ÄúOther receivables,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrade accounts payable‚Äù and ‚ÄúOther liabilities‚Äù contain both financial
instruments and nonfinancial assets or liabilities (such as other tax receivables or advance payments for services to
be received in the future), the reconciliation is shown in the column headed ‚ÄúNonfinancial assets / liabilities.‚Äù

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The loans and receivables reflected in other financial assets and the liabilities measured at amortized cost also
include receivables and liabilities under finance leases in which Bayer is the lessor or lessee and which are therefore measured in accordance with ias 17.
Because of the short maturities of most trade accounts receivable and payable, other receivables and liabilities, and
cash and cash equivalents, their carrying amounts at the closing date did not significantly differ from the fair values.
The fair values of loans and receivables, held-to-maturity financial investments and of financial liabilities carried at
amortized cost that are given for information are the present values of the respective future cash flows. The present
values were determined by discounting the cash flows at a closing-date interest rate, taking into account the term
of the assets or liabilities and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets correspond to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or are
the present values of the respective future cash flows, determined on the basis of unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The fair values of derivatives for which no publicly quoted prices existed in active markets (Level 1) were determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period (Level 2).
In applying valuation techniques, credit value adjustments were determined to allow for the contracting party‚Äôs
credit risk.
Currency and commodity forward contracts were measured individually at their forward rates or forward prices on
the closing date. These depend on spot rates or prices, including time spreads. The fair values of interest-rate
hedging instruments and cross-currency interest-rate swaps were determined by discounting future cash flows
over the remaining terms of the instruments at market rates of interest, taking into account any foreign currency
translation as of the closing date.
Fair values measured using unobservable inputs are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. This
applies to certain available-for-sale debt or equity instruments, in some cases to the fair values of embedded derivatives, and to obligations for contingent consideration in business combinations. Credit risk is frequently the principal unobservable input used to determine the fair values of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale financial assets by the discounted cash flow method. Here we refer to credit spreads of comparable issuers. A significant
increase in credit risk could result in a lower fair value, whereas a significant decrease could result in a higher fair
value. However, a 10% relative change in the credit spread would not materially affect fair value.
Embedded derivatives are separated from their respective host contracts. Such host contracts are generally sales or
purchase agreements relating to the operational business. The embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from the
contracts to vary with exchange-rate or price fluctuations. The internal measurement of embedded derivatives is
mainly performed using the discounted cash flow method, which is based on unobservable inputs. These included
planned sales and purchase volumes, and prices derived from market data. Regular monitoring is carried out based
on these fair values as part of quarterly reporting.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The interest expense of ‚Ç¨703 million (2014: ‚Ç¨550 million) from nonderivative financial liabilities also included the
income and expense from interest-rate swaps that qualified for hedge accounting. Interest income from financial
assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss amounted to ‚Ç¨73 million (2014: ‚Ç¨54 million). Interest income from interest-rate derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting was ‚Ç¨86 million (2014: ‚Ç¨122 million). The
changes in fair values of financial assets held for trading related mainly to forward commodity contracts and embedded derivatives.
Derivatives that constitute financial assets and form part of a master netting arrangement but do not satisfy, or only
partially satisfy, the offsetting criteria and are only enforceable in the event of breach of contract by, or insolvency
of, one of the contracting parties amounted to ‚Ç¨415 million (2014: ‚Ç¨360 million), the related financial liabilities
(derivatives) to ‚Ç¨256 million (2014: ‚Ç¨242 million). Derivatives classified as financial liabilities and forming part of a
master netting arrangement amounted to ‚Ç¨761 million (2014: ‚Ç¨773 million), the related financial assets (derivatives) to ‚Ç¨256 million (2014: ‚Ç¨242 million).

30.2 Maturity analysis
The liquidity risks to which the Bayer Group was exposed from its financial instruments at the end of the reporting
period comprised obligations for future interest and repayment installments on financial liabilities and the liquidity
risk arising from derivatives, as shown in the table in note [30.3].
In addition, loan commitments existed for an as yet unpaid ‚Ç¨1,213 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,005 million) portion of the
effective initial fund of Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG, which may result in further payments by Bayer AG
(‚Ç¨1,005 million) and / or Covestro AG (‚Ç¨208 million) in subsequent years.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

30.3 Information on derivatives
Asset and liability fair values and future cash flows are exposed to currency, interest-rate and commodity price
risks. Derivatives are used to reduce this risk. In some cases they are designated as hedging instruments in a
hedge accounting relationship.
CURRENCY RISKS
Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are hedged using foreign exchange derivatives without the existence of
a hedge accounting relationship. A bond of Bayer AG denominated in British pounds was swapped on the issuance
date into a fixed-rate euro bond by means of a cross-currency interest-rate swap, which was designated as a cash
flow hedge. Certain forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest-rate swaps used to hedge intra-Group
loans are also designated as cash flow hedges.
Fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from forecasted foreign currency transactions and procurement activities
are avoided partly through derivatives contracts, most of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
INTEREST-RATE RISKS
The interest-rate risks from fixed-interest borrowings are managed in part using interest-rate swaps. This applies
mainly to the ‚Ç¨750 million bond issued in 2014, which matures in 2021. Hedge accounting is applied to the respective borrowings and hedging instruments (fair-value hedge).
Losses of ‚Ç¨26 million (2014: ‚Ç¨47 million) were recorded on fair-value hedging instruments in 2015. Gains of
‚Ç¨25 million (2014: ‚Ç¨47 million) were recorded on the underlying hedged items.
COMMODITY PRICE RISKS
Hedging contracts are also used to partly reduce exposure to fluctuations in future cash outflows resulting from
price changes on procurement markets.
HEDGING OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
A portion of the obligations to make variable payments to employees under stock-based compensation programs
(Aspire) is hedged against share price fluctuations using derivatives contracts that are settled in cash at maturity.
These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
FURTHER INFORMATION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES
Accumulated other comprehensive income from cash flow hedges in 2015 decreased by ‚Ç¨203 million (2014:
‚Ç¨102 million) due to changes in the fair values of derivatives net of tax. Losses of ‚Ç¨304 million (2014: gains of
‚Ç¨46 million) from fair-value changes ‚Äì originally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ‚Äì of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges were reclassified to profit or loss. The respective pro-rated deferred
tax income of ‚Ç¨88 million (2014: deferred tax expense of ‚Ç¨13 million) was likewise reclassified to profit or loss.
No material ineffective portions of hedges required recognition in profit or loss in 2015 or 2014.
The income and expense from cash flow hedges recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income mainly
comprised gains of ‚Ç¨91 million (2014: ‚Ç¨115 million) and losses of ‚Ç¨90 million (2014: ‚Ç¨156 million) from the hedging
of forecasted transactions in foreign currencies. Of these gains and losses, gains of ‚Ç¨79 million (2014: ‚Ç¨81 million)
and losses of ‚Ç¨84 million (2014: ‚Ç¨152 million) will be reclassifiable to profit or loss within one year and gains of
‚Ç¨12 million (2014: ‚Ç¨34 million) and losses of ‚Ç¨6 million (2014: ‚Ç¨4 million) in subsequent years.

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Financial commitments resulting from orders already placed under purchase agreements related to planned or
ongoing capital expenditure projects totaled ‚Ç¨690 million (2014: ‚Ç¨476 million).
On December 19, 2015, Bayer entered into an agreement to create a joint venture with crispr therapeutics ag,
Basel, Switzerland. As of December 31, 2015, Bayer had capital contribution obligations of us$370 million in this
connection to crispr therapeutics ag and the joint venture yet to be established. These obligations mature on
December 31, 2020, at the latest.
The Bayer Group has entered into cooperation agreements with third parties under which it has agreed to fund
various research and development projects or has assumed other payment obligations based on the achievement of
certain milestones or other specific conditions. If all of these payments have to be made, their maturity distribution
as of December 31, 2015, was expected to be as set forth in the following table. The amounts shown represent the
maximum payments to be made, and it is unlikely that they will all fall due. Since the achievement of the conditions
for payment is highly uncertain, both the amounts and the dates of the actual payments may vary considerably
from those stated in the table.

In addition to the above commitments, there were also revenue-based milestone payment commitments totaling
‚Ç¨2,241 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,169 million), of which ‚Ç¨2,237 million (2014: ‚Ç¨2,157 million) was not expected to fall due
until 2021 (2014: 2020) or later. These commitments are also highly uncertain.

32. Legal risks
As a global company with a diverse business portfolio, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks, particularly in the areas of product liability, competition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax assessments and environmental matters. The outcome of any current or future proceedings cannot normally be predicted. It is therefore
possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered,
or not fully covered, by insurers‚Äô compensation payments and could significantly affect our revenues and earnings.
Legal proceedings currently considered to involve material risks are outlined below. The legal proceedings referred
to do not represent an exhaustive list.
PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION
Yasmin‚Ñ¢ / yaz‚Ñ¢: As of January 25, 2016, the number of claimants in the pending lawsuits and claims in the United States totaled about 2,300 (excluding claims already settled). Claimants allege that users have suffered personal
injuries, some of them fatal, from the use of Bayer‚Äôs drospirenone-containing oral contraceptive products such as
Yasmin‚Ñ¢ and / or yaz‚Ñ¢ or from the use of Ocella‚Ñ¢ and / or Gianvi‚Ñ¢, generic versions of Yasmin‚Ñ¢ and yaz‚Ñ¢, respectively, marketed by Barr Laboratories, Inc. in the United States. Claimants seek compensatory and punitive damages, claiming, in particular, that Bayer knew or should have known of the alleged risks and should be held liable for
having failed to disclose them or adequately warn users. All cases pending in u.s. federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding for common pre-trial management.

328

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

A few State Attorney Generals in the United States are investigating an alleged off-label promotion of Yasmin‚Ñ¢ and
yaz‚Ñ¢ as well as an alleged failure to warn about an alleged increased risk of developing blood clots in violation of
consumer protection statutes. One Attorney General has filed an action against Bayer.
As of January 25, 2016, 13 lawsuits seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer in Canada. In
one of these lawsuits a class has been certified. Two motions for certification of a class action are pending in Israel.
As of January 25, 2016, Bayer had reached agreements, without admission of liability, to settle approximately
10,300 claims for venous clot injuries (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) for a total amount of about
us$2.04 billion and approximately 7,200 claims for gallbladder injuries for a total amount of about us$21.5 million
in the United States. Bayer will continue to consider the option of settling venous clot injury claims after a casespecific analysis of medical records. At present, about 300 such claims are under review.
In August 2015, Bayer reached an agreement to settle, without admission of liability, lawsuits and claims in which
plaintiffs allege an arterial thromboembolic injury (primarily strokes and heart attacks) for a total maximum aggregate amount of us$56.9 million. Bayer may withdraw from the settlement if fewer than 97.5% of those who are
eligible, and / or fewer than 96% of those who are eligible and allege death or catastrophic injuries, choose to participate. As of January 25, 2016, about 1,200 of the 2,300 above-mentioned claimants alleged arterial thromboembolic injuries.
In August 2015, the u.s. multidistrict and state coordinating courts overseeing the litigation issued case management orders governing all cases before them (regardless of alleged injury), imposing much stricter threshold requirements for litigating the remaining unsettled cases and for filing of new cases. Failing compliance with these
requirements, such cases will be dismissed.
Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Bayer believes that it has meritorious defenses and will continue to defend
itself vigorously against all claims that are not considered for settlement. Bayer has taken appropriate accounting
measures for anticipated defense costs and for agreed and anticipated future settlements based on the information
currently available and based on the number of pending and estimated future claims alleging venous clot injuries.
Mirena‚Ñ¢: As of January 25, 2016, lawsuits from approximately 3,500 users of Mirena‚Ñ¢, a levonorgestrel-releasing
intrauterine system providing long-term contraception, had been served upon Bayer in the United States (excluding lawsuits no longer pending). Most of the cases pending in u.s. federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding for common pre-trial management. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Plaintiffs
allege personal injuries resulting from the use of Mirena‚Ñ¢, including perforation of the uterus, ectopic pregnancy,
or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and seek compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs claim, inter alia,
that Mirena‚Ñ¢ is defective and that Bayer knew or should have known of the risks associated with it and failed to
adequately warn its users. As of January 25, 2016, five lawsuits relating to Mirena‚Ñ¢ seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer in Canada. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself
vigorously. Based on the information currently available, Bayer has taken appropriate accounting measures for
anticipated defense costs.

329

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Xarelto‚Ñ¢: As of January 25, 2016, in the United States, lawsuits from approximately 4,300 recipients of Xarelto‚Ñ¢,
an oral anticoagulant for the treatment and prevention of blood clots, had been served upon Bayer. Plaintiffs allege
personal injuries from the use of Xarelto‚Ñ¢, including cerebral, gastrointestinal or other bleeding and death, and
seek compensatory and punitive damages. They claim, amongst other things, that Xarelto‚Ñ¢ is defective and that
Bayer knew or should have known of the risks associated with the use of Xarelto‚Ñ¢ and failed to adequately warn its
users. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Cases pending in u.s. federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation for common pre-trial management. As of January 25, 2016, eight lawsuits relating to Xarelto‚Ñ¢
seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer in Canada. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. Based on the information currently available, Bayer has taken appropriate accounting measures for anticipated defense costs.
In connection with the above proceedings concerning Yasmin‚Ñ¢ / yaz‚Ñ¢, Mirena‚Ñ¢ and Xarelto‚Ñ¢, Bayer is insured
against product liability risks to the extent customary in the industry. However, the accounting measures taken with
regard to the Yasmin‚Ñ¢ / yaz‚Ñ¢ claims exceed the available insurance coverage.
COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS
Phillips‚Äô Colon Health / Department of Justice: In 2014, the United States Department of Justice, representing the
United States Federal Trade Commission (ftc), filed a motion in a New Jersey federal court contending that Bayer
did not have the requisite support for claims made with respect to Phillips‚Äô Colon Health probiotics. The motion
sought to hold Bayer in contempt of a prior consent order that required Bayer to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate dietary supplement claims. In September 2015, the New Jersey federal court ruled
that the United States failed to satisfy its burden of proving that Bayer failed to possess competent and reliable
scientific evidence. Thus, the court found that Bayer did not violate the consent order. The decision is final.
PATENT DISPUTES
Beyaz‚Ñ¢ / Safyral‚Ñ¢: Beyaz‚Ñ¢ and Safyral‚Ñ¢ are Bayer‚Äôs oral contraceptives containing folate. In September 2015, a
u.s. federal court ruled in favor of Bayer regarding both the validity of its patent and the infringement thereof by
Watson Laboratories, Inc. Watson had filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with a Paragraph iv certification
(‚Äúanda iv‚Äù) seeking approval of generic versions of both Beyaz‚Ñ¢ and Safyral‚Ñ¢ in the United States. Watson appealed the decision. In May and October 2015, Bayer filed two suits against Lupin Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (together ‚ÄúLupin‚Äù) in u.s. federal court for infringement of the same patent. In April and September 2015,
Bayer had received two notices of an anda iv by Lupin seeking approval to market generic versions of Safyral‚Ñ¢ and
Beyaz‚Ñ¢ in the United States.
Betaferon‚Ñ¢ / Betaseron‚Ñ¢: In 2010, Bayer filed a complaint against Biogen Idec ma Inc. in u.s. federal court seeking a declaration by the court that a patent issued to Biogen in 2009 is invalid and not infringed by Bayer‚Äôs production and distribution of Betaseron‚Ñ¢, Bayer‚Äôs drug product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Biogen is alleging
patent infringement by Bayer through Bayer‚Äôs production and distribution of Betaseron‚Ñ¢ and Extavia‚Ñ¢ and has
sued Bayer accordingly. Bayer manufactures Betaseron‚Ñ¢ and distributes the product in the United States. Extavia‚Ñ¢
is also a drug product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; it is manufactured by Bayer, but distributed in the
United States by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, another defendant in the lawsuit.

330

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Finacea‚Ñ¢: In July 2015, a u.s. federal court found that Bayer‚Äôs patent relating to Finacea‚Ñ¢ topical gel is valid and
infringed by Glenmark Generics Ltd. Glenmark had filed an anda iv seeking approval of a generic version of Finacea‚Ñ¢ in the United States, and Glenmark appealed the us federal court decision.
Damoctocog alfa pegol (bay 94-9027, long-acting rFVIII): In 2013, Bayer filed a lawsuit against Nektar Therapeutics in the district court of Munich, Germany. In this proceeding, Bayer claims rights to certain European patent
applications based on a past collaboration between Bayer and Nektar in the field of hemophilia. The European
patent applications with the title ‚ÄúPolymer-factor viii moiety conjugates‚Äù are part of a patent family registered in
the name of Nektar comprising further patent applications and patents in other countries including the United
States. However, Bayer believes that the patent family does not include any valid patent claim relevant for Bayer‚Äôs
drug candidate bay 94-9027 for the treatment of hemophilia a.
Nexavar‚Ñ¢: In January and December 2015, Bayer filed patent infringement lawsuits in a u.s. federal court against
Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (together ‚ÄúMylan‚Äù). In December 2014 and in November 2015, Bayer
had received notices of anda iv applications pursuant to which Mylan seeks approval of a generic version of
Bayer¬¥s cancer drug Nexavar‚Ñ¢ in the United States.
Staxyn‚Ñ¢: Staxyn‚Ñ¢ is a Bayer product for erectile dysfunction treatment. It is an orodispersible (orally disintegrating) formulation of Levitra‚Ñ¢. Both drug products contain the same active ingredient, which is protected in the
United States by two patents expiring in 2018. In 2012, Bayer received notice of an anda iv application pursuant to
which Watson seeks approval to market a generic version of Bayer‚Äôs erectile dysfunction treatment Staxyn‚Ñ¢ prior
to patent expiration in the United States. Bayer filed a patent infringement suit in a u.s. federal court against Watson Laboratories, Inc. In April 2015, the court ruled that both of Bayer‚Äôs compound patents are valid and infringed.
Watson may appeal.
Xarelto‚Ñ¢: In October 2015, Bayer and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a patent infringement suit in a u.s.
federal court against Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma usa, Inc. (together ‚ÄúAurobindo‚Äù), Breckenridge Pharmaceutical Inc. (‚ÄúBreckenridge‚Äù), Micro Labs Ltd., Micro Labs usa Inc. (together ‚ÄúMicro Labs‚Äù), Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Inc. (together ‚ÄúMylan‚Äù), Prinston Pharmaceutical Inc. (‚ÄúPrinston‚Äù), Sigmapharm Laboratories, llc (‚ÄúSigmapharm‚Äù), Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Limited and Torrent Pharma Inc. (together ‚ÄúTorrent‚Äù). In
September 2015, Bayer had received notices of an anda iv application by Aurobindo, Breckenridge, Micro Labs,
Mylan, Prinston, Sigmapharm and Torrent, each seeking approval to market a generic version of Xarelto‚Ñ¢, an oral
anticoagulant for the treatment and prevention of blood clots, in the United States. In January 2016, Bayer received
another notice of such an anda iv application by InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‚ÄúInvaGen‚Äù). In February 2016,
Bayer and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a patent infringement suit against InvaGen in the same u.s. federal
court.
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses in the above patent disputes and intends to defend itself vigorously.
FURTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Trasylol‚Ñ¢ / Avelox‚Ñ¢: A qui tam complaint relating to marketing practices for Trasylol‚Ñ¢ (aprotinin) and Avelox‚Ñ¢
(moxifloxacin) filed by a former Bayer employee is pending in the United States District Court in New Jersey. The
u.s. government has declined to intervene at the present time.
Newark Bay Environmental Matters: In the United States, Bayer is one of numerous parties involved in a series of
claims brought by federal and state environmental protection agencies. The claims arise from operations by entities
which historically were conducted near Newark Bay or surrounding bodies of water, or which allegedly discharged
hazardous waste into these waterways or onto nearby land. Bayer and the other potentially responsible parties are
being asked to remediate and contribute to the payment of past and future remediation or restoration costs and
damages.

331

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In the Lower Passaic River matter, a group of more than sixty companies including Bayer is investigating contaminated sediments in the riverbed under the supervision of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (epa)
and other governmental authorities. Future remediation will involve some form of dredging, the nature and scope
of which are not yet defined, and potentially other tasks. The cost of the investigation and the remediation work
may be substantial if the final remedy involves extensive dredging and disposal of impacted sediments. In the
Newark Bay matter, an unaffiliated party is currently conducting an investigation of sediments in Newark Bay
under epa supervision. The investigation is in a preliminary stage. Bayer has contributed to certain investigation
costs in the past and may incur costs for future investigation and remediation activities in Newark Bay.
Bayer has also been notified by governmental authorities acting as natural resource trustees that it may have liability for natural resource damages arising from the contamination of the Lower Passaic River, Newark Bay and surrounding water bodies. Bayer is currently unable to determine the extent of its liability.
Asbestos: A further risk may arise from asbestos litigation in the United States. In many cases, the plaintiffs allege
that Bayer and co-defendants employed third parties on their sites in past decades without providing them with
sufficient warnings or protection against the known dangers of asbestos. Additionally, a Bayer affiliate in the United States is the legal successor to companies that sold asbestos products until 1976. Union Carbide has agreed to
indemnify Bayer for this liability. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.
TAX PROCEEDINGS
Stamp taxes in Greece: In 2014, a Greek administrative court of first instance dismissed Bayer‚Äôs lawsuit against
the assessment of stamp taxes and contingent penalties in the total amount of approximately ‚Ç¨23 million on certain
intra-Group loans to a Greek subsidiary. Bayer is convinced that the decision is wrong and has appealed. In two
additional court proceeding of first instance before the same court, Bayer has filed lawsuits against the assessment
of stamp taxes and contingent penalties in an amount of approximately ‚Ç¨90 million and a further amount of approximately ‚Ç¨16 million. Bayer believes it has meritorious arguments to support its legal position and intends to defend
itself vigorously.

Notes to the Statements of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows shows how cash inflows and outflows during the fiscal year affected the cash and cash
equivalents of the Bayer Group. Cash flows are classified by operating, investing and financing activities in accordance with ias 7 (Statement of Cash Flows). Effects of changes in the scope of consolidation are stated separately.
Of the cash and cash equivalents, an amount of ‚Ç¨17 million (2014: ‚Ç¨72 million) had limited availability due to foreign exchange restrictions. Past experience has shown such restrictions to be of short duration. The above amount
included ‚Ç¨3 million (2014: ‚Ç¨64 million) of exchange-restricted cash in Venezuela. The conversion of cash from
Venezuelan bolivars (vef) into u.s. dollars is subject to a government approval process.
The cash flows reported by consolidated companies outside the eurozone are translated at average monthly exchange rates, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents, which are translated at closing rates. The ‚ÄúChange
in cash and cash equivalents due to exchange rate movements‚Äù is reported in a separate line item.

332

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

33. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
The gross cash flow from continuing operations, amounting in 2015 to ‚Ç¨6,999 million (2014: ‚Ç¨6,707 million), is the
cash surplus from operating activities before any changes in working capital. The cash flows by segment are shown
in note [1].
The net operating cash flow (total) of ‚Ç¨6,890 million (2014: ‚Ç¨5,810 million) also takes into account the changes in
working capital and other noncash transactions.
An income-tax-related net cash outflow of ‚Ç¨1,699 million (2014: ‚Ç¨1,835 million) is included in the net cash flow for
2015. The changes in income tax liabilities, income tax provisions and claims for reimbursement of income taxes
are shown in the line item ‚ÄúChanges in other working capital, other noncash items.‚Äù
The transfers of bonds with a total value of ‚Ç¨300 million (2014: ‚Ç¨250 million) to pension funds were noncash transactions and therefore did not result in an operating cash outflow.

34. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities
The net cash outflow for investing activities in 2015 amounted to ‚Ç¨2,762 million (2014: ‚Ç¨15,539 million).
Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in 2015 resulted in a cash outflow of

Total

The fees for the auditing of financial statements mainly comprised those for the audits of the consolidated financial
statements of the Bayer Group and the financial statements of Bayer AG and its subsidiaries. The increase in fees
for financial statements auditing and for audit-related services and other audit work mainly resulted from the carveout and stock market flotation of Covestro.
The Independent Auditor‚Äôs Report on the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 was signed by Dr. Peter
Bartels and Eckhard Sprinkmeier. Dr. Peter Bartels signed the Independent Auditor‚Äôs Report for the first time for
the year ended December 31, 2012, and Eckhard Sprinkmeier for the year ended December 31, 2014. PwC has
served as the auditor of Bayer‚Äôs consolidated financial statements since the merger of Price Waterhouse Deutschland and Coopers & Lybrand Deutsche Revision in 1998. The predecessor firm of Coopers & Lybrand Deutsche

Report of the independent auditor of the consolidated financial statements
To Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen
The following Independent Auditor‚Äôs Report was issued for the complete set of consolidated financial
statements and the combined management report of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen, and its
subsidiaries. For reasons of clarity, the notes to the consolidated financial statements, to which this
Independent Auditor‚Äôs Report also refers, are not included in this print version of the Annual Report.
The consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto are published in German and English
in the electronic version of the German Federal Gazette and will also be included in an augmented German print version of the Annual Report to be available at the Annual Stockholders‚Äô Meeting of Bayer AG
on April 29, 2016.
REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and
its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive
income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
the business year from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.
Board of Management‚Äôs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Management of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. This responsibility includes that these consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the e.u.,
and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to ¬ß (Article) 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 hgb (‚ÄúHandelsgesetzbuch‚Äù: German Commercial Code) and that these consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group in accordance with these requirements. The Board of Management is also responsible for the
internal controls as the Board of Management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
Auditor‚Äôs Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with ¬ß 317 hgb and German generally accepted standards
for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr√ºfer (Institute of
Public Auditors in Germany) (idw) and additionally observed the International Standards on Auditing
(isa). Accordingly, we are required to comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The selection of audit procedures depends on the
auditor‚Äôs professional judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In assessing those risks, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity‚Äôs preparation of consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view. The aim of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that
are appropriate in the given circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriate-

339

ness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Audit Opinion
According to ¬ß 322 Abs. 3 Satz (sentence) 1 hgb, we state that our audit of the consolidated financial
statements has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply, in all
material respects, with ifrss, as adopted by the e.u., and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to ¬ß 315a Abs. 1 hgb and give a true and fair view of the net assets and financial
position of the Group as at December 31, 2015 as well as the results of operations for the business year
then ended, in accordance with these requirements..
REPORT ON THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
We have audited the accompanying Group management report of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft for the business year from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, which is combined with the management report
of the company. The Board of Management of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for the preparation of the combined management report in accordance with the requirements of German commercial
law applicable pursuant to ¬ß 315a Abs. 1 hgb. We conducted our audit in accordance with ¬ß 317 Abs. 2
hgb and German generally accepted standards for the audit of the combined management report promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr√ºfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (idw). Accordingly, we are required to plan and perform the audit of the combined management report to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the audit findings, as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group‚Äôs
position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
According to ¬ß 322 Abs. 3 Satz 1 hgb, we state that our audit of the combined management report has
not led to any reservations.
In our opinion based on the findings of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and combined
management report, the combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements, as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group‚Äôs position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Independent Assurance Report

Independent Practitioner‚Äôs Limited Assurance
Report on the sustainability information in the
online annexes of the augmented online
version of the Annual Report of Bayer AG 2015
To Bayer AG, Leverkusen
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the sustainability information
marked with ‚Äûlimited assurance‚Äú in the online annexes of the augmented online version of the Annual
Report of Bayer AG, Leverkusen, (hereinafter: the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) for the period January 1, 2015 to
December 31, 2015 (‚ÄúAnnual Report 2015 ‚Äì Augmented Version‚Äù; hereinafter: ‚ÄúOnline Version‚Äù).
MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS RESPONSIBILITY
Company‚Äôs Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Online Version in
accordance with the criteria as set out in the g4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global
Reporting Initiative (gri) (hereafter the ‚Äúgri-Criteria‚Äù) and for the selection of the information to be
assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Online
Version as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which
are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing
and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Online Version, which is free
of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.
AUDIT FIRM‚ÄôS INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other
ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards ‚Äì in particular the
Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (‚ÄúBerufssatzung f√ºr
Wirtschaftspr√ºfer und vereidigte Buchpr√ºfer‚Äú: ‚Äúbs wp/vBP‚Äù) as well as the joint opinion of the
Wirtschaftspr√ºferkammer (Chamber of German Public Auditors; wpk) and the Institut der Wirtschaftspr√ºfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; idw): Requirements to quality control for audit firms
(‚ÄúGemeinsamen Stellungnahme der wpk und des idw: Anforderungen an die Qualit√§tssicherung in der
Wirtschaftspr√ºferpraxis‚Äù: ‚Äúvo 1/2006‚Äù) ‚Äì and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
PRACTITIONER‚ÄôS RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information marked with ‚Äûlimited assurance‚Äú in the Online Version based on our work performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or
expert opinions, referred to in the Online Version.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(isae) 3000 (Revised): ‚ÄúAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
Information‚Äù published by iaasb. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to
believe that the sustainability information marked with ‚Äû limited assurance‚Äú in the Online Version has
not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the gri-Criteria.

341

Bayer Annual Report 2015
Independent Assurance Report

In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement. This
includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information marked
with ‚Äû limited assurance‚Äúin the Online Version with regard to the gri-Criteria.
Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures:
‚Ä¢ Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder
engagement;
‚Ä¢ Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report regarding the preparation process
and the underlying internal control system;
‚Ä¢ Documentation of the processes and inspection of the systems and processes regarding the
collection of the sustainability information as well as sample testing;
‚Ä¢ Site visits as part of the inspection of processes and analysis of selected data at the following sites:
‚Äì Bayer HealthCare, Berkeley, usa
‚Äì Bayer CropScience, Muskegon, usa
‚Äì Covestro, Maasvlakte, Niederlande
‚Äì Covestro, Map Ta Phut, Thailand
‚Äì Sites on the Lower Rhine, Germany;
‚Ä¢ Analytical procedures on selected sustainability information of the Online Version;
‚Ä¢ Inspection of internal documents, contracts and invoices as well as reports.
CONCLUSION
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information marked with ‚Äû limited assurance‚Äú in the Online Version of the
Company for the period January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 has not been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the gri-Criteria.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER ‚Äì RECOMMENDATIONS
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further
development of the Company's sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
‚Ä¢ Further alignment of the sustainability reporting in consideration of the changing focus topics of a
life science company:
‚Ä¢ Further development of the management approaches and their presentation in the integrated
reporting;
‚Ä¢ Further focusing, improving and formalizing internal control systems at central level and at the level
of individual sites.
RESTRICTION ON USE AND DISTRIBUTION
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Bayer AG. The audit has been
performed for purposes of Bayer AG and is solely intended to inform Bayer AG about the results of the
audit. The report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decision thereon.

We align our compensation with local market

with our human rights position, we pursue the
goal of paying adequate salaries that ensure a
suitable standard of living for our employees
and their families. In all Emerging Markets
where we are active, the lowest salary paid by
Bayer is at least in line with the applicable
minimum wage and in most cases higher. We
are not currently reporting on the margin
between standard entry salary and minimum
wage. We intend to perform a new survey on
this aspect.

Capital invested (ci) Capital
invested comprises the assets
on which the company must
obtain a return by generating
an appropriate cash inflow; in
some cases, the cost of ultimately reproducing the assets
must be earned in addition.
Cash flow Key indicator for
assessing a company‚Äôs financial strength; in addition to
gross cash flow, the statement
of cash flows also reports the
cash flow from operating
activities (net cash flow),
which shows the amount of
funds available from operating
activities for financing investments, repaying debts or
distributing dividends. The
cash flows from investing and
financing activities are also
reported.

Cash flow return on investment (cfroi) The cfroi is the
difference between the gross
cash flow in the reporting
period and the cost of reproducing depletable assets,
divided by the capital invested. The cfroi is thus a measure of the return on capital
employed in the reporting
period.

Conflict minerals are those
mined in conflict regions.
They include tin, tungsten and
tantalum ores, gold or their
derivatives. Among the regions in which armed conflicts
over the control of these
resources occur are the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo and neighboring countries.

Cash value added (cva) This
is the difference between the
gross cash flow and the gross
cash flow hurdle. It is therefore the amount by which the
gross cash flow exceeds the
return and reproduction requirements. If cva is positive,
the investors‚Äô return and
reproduction requirements
have been satisfied and value
has been created for the company.

Continuing operations Revenue and earnings reporting
for continuing operations
pertains only to business
operations that are expected
to remain in the company‚Äôs
portfolio for the foreseeable
future; opposite of discontinued operations.

cdp (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) is an independent, not-for-profit organization that works on behalf of
analysts and investors to
promote the transparent reporting of greenhouse gas
emissions and water use
(Water Disclosure Report) by
companies. cdp publishes two
climate rankings each year:
the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (cdli) rates the
extent and quality of the
disclosure of climate-relevant
data, while the best-rated
companies are additionally
listed in the Climate Performance Leadership Index
(cpli).
