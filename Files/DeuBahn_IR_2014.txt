ABOUT THIS REPORT

Fulfilled reporting standards

In our integrated report, we fulfill all of the standards
applicable in Germany for financial reporting and the
international guidelines (G3) of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting. The GRI
Index starting on page 285 provides compact information
about the GRI indicators.
Integrated reporting: what does it mean?

Integrated reporting is more than just a simple com­
bination of the Annual Report and the Sustainability
Report. In our integrated report, we want to collect
information, combine it, and present it in context.
Our aim: a comprehensive overview of DB Group and
strategy with its three dimensions:
its DB 2020
economic ≈ , social † and environmental ¥ .

How do you use this Report?

In order to simplify using this report,
we have added a few features that,
for example, serve to link information
or go into greater depth.

Supplemental information
Supplements

We have also highlighted an additional level of information next to the main text.
We distinguish between two forms: critical topics and in-depth information.

Critical topics

On our way into the
digital future
Action Plan Digitalization

Dr. Rüdiger Grube, CEO and Chairman

“

We are facing the most radical change
since the German Rail Reform,
and we have to adjust to the changing
realities of people’s lives.

”

The digital revolution is taking place in our markets in the mobility and logistics sector, and in
the rail infrastructure sector. The needs of customers are changing. Competitive pressure
is increasing. Information and communications technologies are already exercising a major
influence on passenger and freight transport. They will revolutionize our products, our
business models, and how we do our work. Mobility 4.0, Infrastructure 4.0, Logistics 4.0
and Working World 4.0: we, at DB Group, are shaping the digital future with these four
initiatives. We are also working on an innovation-friendly culture because there are major
opportunities for us in the digital age!

Digitalization
requires contributions
from all parts
of DB Group. We have
resolved to embrace
this change and, in so
doing, to shape
the future.

Industry 4.0: the “Internet of Things”
contains the connection
between the real world and
the virtual one.

Digitalization is not just a trend;
it is the fourth industrial revolution.
It is becoming increasingly impor­­tant for us to digitize our products and
adjust to customer needs in real time.
Digitalization offers us a major oppor­
tunity to gain long-term customer loyalty
and approach new target groups.

Digitalization requires innovation and new ways of
thinking, better networking and teamwork
with agile decision-making. The digital world
is already part of our everyday core business. The public mobility mix – train, bus,
car-sharing, bike rentals – now offers what
until recently was only possible with your
own car: freedom and flexibility. Digita­
lization is opening up new opportunities
for all of our custom­­ers and employees,
for the environment, and therefore
for DB Group’s sustainable success in
the context of our DB2020
strategy.

Internet access and comprehen­­sive travel information will become
increasingly important for customers
when selecting their means of transport.
We also have to continue digitizing
our customer interfaces in the transport
and logistics business. This is why we
are constantly strengthening our digital
products. Big data has long been
a reality for us.

Infomobile Noise Prevention

Dr. Heike Hanagarth, Technology and Environment

“

We are relying on a Group-wide strategy
To protect residents who are
affected by railway noise. Our target
is to cut in half the level of rail
transport noise by 2020.

”

Traffic noise is one of our greatest environmental problems. And railway traffic also
generates noise. We believe that we, in particular, have to meet our high environmental
standards. In our DB2020
strategy, we have committed to cutting our rail noise
levels from 2000 in half by 2020. This means a noise reduction of 10 dB(A), which
corresponds to half of what the human ear perceives as noise. The most environ­
mentally friendly mode of transport – rail – should therefore take on a pioneering
role in reducing noise.

560

km of sound barriers have been
built up to now and 53,400
apartments have been equipped
with noise-control measures.

The Infomobile Noise
Pre­vention is underway through­
­out Germany, providing informational events for the public.
Interactive exhibits make
noise prevention tangible.

.

In order to be able to reach our goal by
2020, we are setting our sights on a com­
prehensive total concept that is based
fundamentally on two pillars: local fixed
noise-reduction measures on routes
and buildings, and reducing noise on the
vehicles themselves. Around 11% of our
34,000 km rail network are considered
heavily polluted with noise. We prefer
to build local noise protection in the form
of sound barriers and facilities directly
on the tracks in these noisy sections.

The most effective method, however, is to prevent noise directly at its source: where the
wheels meet the rail. What causes noise are brake shoes made out of gray cast iron because
over time the wheel surfaces become abraded and this causes them to produce more
noise. The Europe-wide approval of LL brake shoes in mid -2013 means that
existing freight cars can be upgraded without expensive overhauls
of the braking systems. This cuts the rolling noise of the freight cars
in half compared to conventional gray cast iron brake shoes. This
upgrade therefore makes the most sustainable impact on noise
reduction.

Focusing on developing
young talent
Graduate trainee program “Finance Track”

Dr. Richard Lutz, CFO

“

For a successful future of DB Group,
it is also of fundamental importance to be
attractive to young people who want
to start their professional career. Our
answer In the financial sector is
the ‘Finance Track.’

”

The finance department has agreed on essential themes in the “F2020” agenda so that
we can support our goal of becoming a top employer. The priorities in this agenda
are to develop our employees and to secure qualified new talent in order to be able
to fill specialist and management positions from our own ranks in the mediumand long-term. One building block for this is our inter-divisional “Finance Track”
graduate trainee program. This program prepares our graduate trainees in
18 months for their future tasks in DB Group’s financial department.

Act before damages occur
Avoiding cartel damages

Gerd Becht, Compliance,
Privacy, Legal Affairs and Group Security

“

Our system for preventing cartel
damages establishes the foundation
for sustainable compliance with
procurement prices that are in line
with the market.

”

Tight markets with few suppliers and high purchasing volumes increase the danger of cartels
for DB Group. This presents us with two challenges: first, we have to uncover cases as
they occur. We rigorously prosecute cartel members and assert claims for damages. In
the last three years, we were able to reach payments for damages in the three-digitmillion range. Second, we rely on prevention to prevent damages in the future. In Jan­
uary 2014, we were the first German company to introduce a comprehensive cartel
damages prevention system as a preventive measure against damages resulting from
cartels among suppliers.

The cartel damages prevention system is meant
to identify, qualify and reduce cartel risks.
This requires, among other things, training
programs to make procurement employees
aware of the risks of cartels, as well as eco­
nomic screening methods for identifying
markets that lean toward cartels. Suppliers
in these markets are then required to
introduce antitrust compliance programs.
Processes have also been implemented
across Europe to monitor antitrust
authorities.

Cartel damages prevention is more than legal consulting. It is also about the effective
integration of prevention mechanisms in purchasing processes. We can only
fully attain our goals with regard to cartel damages prevention through committed,
inter-divisional teamwork. This also strengthens the acceptance of the entire
pre­vention system. The introduction of this kind of system is therefore an
essential contribution to the realization of the goals of DB2020 , for
both economic and social reasons.

Developing the strategies of
tomorrow with our employees
Culture development

Ulrich Weber, Human Resources

“

A good corporate culture doesn’t come
about on its own. We have to work
on it. A lot of small steps at the beginning
will create a major transformation
at the end.

”

A future-proof company needs not only a pioneering strategy and well-functioning

structures, but also a strong culture. We want a culture that enables executives
and employees to give their best and to be satisfied with their work and their working
environment. This is why a continued dialog about how we can best harmonize
the needs of employees with the company’s requirements is so important.

the future are the next
step in our cultural devel­­
opment process towards
a stronger focus on implemen­­
tation. We need a continuous
process that constantly tells us where
we stand. This is why we again asked
employees to give us their opinion in the fall of
2014. In 2015, we will work intensively with the results to evaluate
what has changed in comparison to 2012 and to develop new measures
for improving teamwork. This is because if employee satisfaction
goes up, we will be able to offer customers better services – that is
what we believe.

was the result of the 2014 employee
survey. This puts us in the range
of “good employee satisfaction” —
with room to improve.

300,000 employees around the world
were called upon to participate
in the second Group-wide employee
survey – in 67 countries and 36 languages. About 190,000, or 60.1% of all
DB employees, participated.

We want a corporate culture in which employees and
managers can act on their own initiative, think in innova­
tive terms, and constructively contribute to change.
To reach this goal, everyone has to pitch in – employees
and managers as well as representatives. This is because
a live cooperation between employer and employee represen­
tatives is part of a good corporate culture. This is why we
insist on strong, confident trade unions and works councils that
collaborate with us as partners on the future of our company.

Modern infrastructure
for the future
High-performance Infrastructure

Dr. Volker Kefer, Infrastructure and Services

“

The second performance and financing agreement is a milestone in infra­s tructure
financing. The greatest modernization program
in the history of DB Group is getting the
rail network ready for the future and gives us
the opportunity to tackle investment delays.

”

Our second Performance and Financing Agreement (LuFV II), developed jointly with
the Federal Government in 2014, signals a clear commitment to the existing net­work. It is particularly worth noting the implementation of what is called the closed
financing circle: with the LuFV II, every cent earned by railway infrastructure
companies is paid as a dividend to the federal budget and is then returned in
full to the infrastructure. The LuFV II is a mammoth program for the existing
network; it is a challenge and an opportunity at the same time.

Meeting new mobility needs
Initiative Mobility 4.0

Ulrich Homburg, Passenger Transport

“

Technological developments and several
new providers will increasingly
change individual mobility. We will develop
innovative products and services
in the context of the initiative Mobility 4.0.

”

Our new initiative Mobility 4.0 launched in 2014 is dedicated to the future field of
digitalization in passenger transport. Our customers want customized mobility.
They expect smart solutions. New competitors are responding to this and flooding
the mobility market. We want to take advantage of this field of the future
and take part in shaping it. The focus is centered on three main questions: How
is the mobility market of the future developing and how will DB Group be
positioned within it? With which products and services will we excite our
customers? How can we design an even more high-performance organiza­
tion with increased innovative capacity?

Many paths lead to the same
destination. In passenger transport,
we respond to about 90 million
travel information requests per month
on the mobile Internet. With our apps,
such as Qixxit and DB Navigator,
or regional apps such as the one for the
S-Bahn (metro) Berlin, we give our
customers fast and flexible information
about their optimal travel plans.

13

million: the number of
times the DB Navigator APP

With our new DB Mobility Lab, we are creating space for ideas. It serves
us as a radar for trends and technology, especially through internal
and external networking. Modular working areas permit maximum flexibility.
We want to support innovation from the idea to the prototypes to the
transfer into line functions. The Lab serves in this process as a pacesetter.
We will offer innovative products and services in the context of the
initiative Mobility 4.0 so that we can continue to excite our customers with
smart solutions well into the future.

Next Generation eServices

“

Whether land, air or OCEAN Freight,
eSchenker offers our customers
one system for everything: With uniform
standards and flexible solutions.

”

eServices, or Web-based services, are playing an increasingly important role in logistics.
For some time, eSchenker has offered our customers the opportunity to take ad­­
vantage of various online services. However, multiple parallel platforms have existed
up to now without uniform standards, meaning with global, regional and local
differences in electronic services. These products have now been bundled into one
platform called eSchenker.

Our integrated thinking is showing us the way

The gigantic and successful whole is like a puzzle that con­
sists of several individual parts. An overall image will only
emerge if all of the parts synchronize perfectly. This also
applies to the achievement of visions and targets.
Our sustainable DB2020
strategy proves that we are
striving for harmony and unity in the economic ≈, environmental ¥ and social † dimensions. To do this, it is essential
to consider contexts, connections and interdependencies,
and to incorporate them into decision-making processes. An
essential requirement for this is integrated thinking, which
we want to express by means of our integrated reporting.

Integrated thinking for us means a constant and continuous
engagement with all three dimensions of sustainability. In
our decisions, we consider how actions in one area can affect
other areas, and in the end how this all affects our top tar­
gets. To do this, we observe such things as trends and devel­
opments in our markets, constantly connect financial and
non-financial information, assess opportunities and risks,
and then derive recommendations for what to do next.
We do this out of a deep conviction that companies can
only be sustainably successful if they deliver a solid perfor­
mance in all three dimensions – economic, social and environmental.

1.1

We are pleased to present the first Integrated Report of Deutsche Bahn Group. The Annual Report
and the Sustainability Report have been merged into one compact package. For the first time, the
Integrated Report brings together all of the facts and figures for the financial year 2014 from the three
dimensions economic, social and environmental, as well as a great deal of supplemental information
on current developments within Deutsche Bahn Group – at one time, in one publication.
The parallel online reporting at www.deutschebahn.com/ib-e has become even more comprehensive
and user-friendly. All of the following text and illustrations have been fully digitized and can also be
viewed on smartphones and tablets.
The Integrated Report represents a leap in qualitative and quantitative terms. Financial and nonfinancial developments are described in similar ways. One of the completely new features is the
results of our first stakeholder survey. The report places business figures in their proper context,
connects information and illuminates mutual effects within the Group.
We want to make it even easier for you to understand our business and what we are doing in terms
of improvement. Our first Integrated Report is less of a retrospective balance sheet than it is taking
stock of our company as we look to the future.
We are following the logic of our DB2020 strategy, namely to fully and equally cover all three
dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental.
2014 is an important benchmark with regard to our strategy. It has been three years since we put
DB2020
on track. One-third of the time frame is now up. How have we done in the last three years?
We are further than we planned in a few areas. We have even reached a few targets already. We
continue to work hard on other target values to defend and improve our market positions.
The new passenger record proves that our efforts in product quality and customer satisfaction are
paying off in our core business. Out of a total of 2.03 billion passengers, we had 14 million additional
passengers in 2014 in our trains in Germany alone. And this was despite a year with 165 hours of
strikes by the GDL and days of limited rail capacity due to the destruction wreaked by storm Ela in
early summer. Regional transport in metropolitan areas continued to develop especially positively.
Customer growth in rail traffic contributed to an increase of revenues by 1.5 percent to € 39.7 billion
in 2014. Operating profit before interest and taxes is again over € 2 billion, which is slightly below
the previous year’s figures due to the aforementioned external influences.
We have made significant strides with regard to our attractiveness as an employer. Among heavily
recruited engineering graduates, Deutsche Bahn Group broke into the Top Ten most attractive
employers in Germany for the first time in Universum’s company rankings. The market research
institute trendence even included Deutsche Bahn Group as one of the last five years’ high achievers
among college graduates.
Our high attractiveness as an employer is also demonstrated in our low employee turnover rate and
the low dropout rate among vocational trainees. While 24 percent of all vocational trainees in Germany
leave their training workplace prematurely, this figure is only 11 percent at Deutsche Bahn Group.

To our stakeholder s

Chairman’s letter

With a total of over 12,000 new colleagues brought on board, we are once again among the employers
with the most new hires.
Deutsche Bahn Group is setting standards in Germany both as an employer and as an eco-pioneer.
The share of renewable energy in the traction current mix is now just under 40 percent. And we have
already achieved our target of reducing our global specific CO₂ emissions by 20 percent between 2006
and 2020; we hit 22.7 percent this year, six years ahead of schedule.
Clearly, we cannot rest on the laurels of our success, or ignore the targets we have not yet completed.
On the contrary: we will meet increasing competition in the mobility market with new product concepts
that provide clear advantages to our customers.
In doing so, we want to take full advantage of the various opportunities presented by digitalization.
We already handle about 90 million travel information requests concerning passenger transport per
month on the mobile Internet. Big data has long been a reality for us. Nevertheless, we are still at
the beginning. We will actively shape the future of mobility and logistics with our 4.0 initiatives.
Demand for rail services is growing. This is clear from rising passenger numbers. We will lay the
foundation for further growth with the largest modernization program for the existing rail infrastructure that there has ever been. Together with the Federal Government, we are investing about
€ 28 billion in the existing network in the next five years. Approximately € 7 billion more will go to
new construction and expansion lines.
We are looking forward with optimism and confidence. It is clear that digitalization will lead to
even more far-reaching disruptions in the mobility and logistics markets. Deutsche Bahn Group is
also facing the greatest change since the German Rail Reform of 1994. Yet we view this upheaval as
a lift-off! We will be leaders in the digital transformation, not followers. And we will still keep a
cool head.
We will continue following the course laid out in our DB2020
strategy. This is exactly why
Deutsche Bahn Group will continue representing stability, solidity, quality and reliability, as well as
comprehensive and sustainable business success.

In view of the integrated Group management structure,
the report of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bahn AG
(DB AG) also includes, for information purposes only, the
report of the Supervisory Board of DB Mobility Logistics AG
(DB ML AG).
In the year under review, the Supervisory Boards of
DB AG and DB ML AG observed the entire responsibilities
incumbent upon them by virtue of the law, the company’s
Articles of Association and its bylaws. The Supervisory
Boards extensively advised and supervised the respective
Management Board in the management of the companies
and business operations. The Management Boards reported
regularly, without delay and in detail to the Supervisory
Boards regarding corporate planning and the business,
strategic and financial development of DB AG and its subsidiaries respectively of DB ML AG and its subsidiaries. All
significant business events were discussed by the Supervisory Boards and the responsible committees based on
Management Boards’ reports. Significant deviations in the
actual business development were explained by the respective Management Board and examined by the respective
Supervisory Board. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Boards
of DB AG and DB ML AG maintained close contact at all
times with the Chairman of the Management Boards of
DB AG and DB ML AG, who regularly reported on the latest
business developments at DB AG and/or DB ML AG, upcoming business decisions and risk management.

Supervisory Board Meetings
DB AG
The Supervisory Board of DB AG was involved in all decisions of fundamental significance for DB AG.
In the year under review, the Supervisory Board of DB AG
met for four ordinary meetings, one extraordinary meeting
and one strategy meeting. One Supervisory Board mem­­
ber fully participated in less than half of the meetings held
in the year under review. No resolutions were adopted by
written ballot in the year under review. Meetings of the
Executive Committee, the Personnel Committee and the
Audit and Compliance Committee were held in preparation for the meetings of the Supervisory Board of DB AG.

The main issues discussed in the plenary meetings were
the development of Deutsche Bahn Group’s (DB Group)
revenues, profit and employment situation, as well as capital expenditures and participation projects. The Super­­
visory Board also discussed the strategy of DB Group and
of the major business units and/or Group divisions at its
special strategy meeting.
In the year under review, the Supervisory Board worked
intensively in all of its meetings on the financing of rail
infrastructure and the performance and financing agreement between the Federal Government and DB AG, which
was renegotiated in 2014. In all scheduled meetings during
the year under review, the Supervisory Board intensively
dealt with the progress and cost development of the major
Stuttgart 21/Wendlingen-Ulm project. Furthermore, the
Super­­visory Board discussed the delivery situation for
ordered rolling stock, which remains unsatisfactory.
In a special strategy session, the market and competition situation for the major business units was subjected to
intensive discussion. The focus of the Supervisory Board’s
deliberations, both in its strategy sessions and regularly
scheduled meetings, was on the effect that the opening up
of the long-distance bus market has had on DB rail passen­
­ger transport.
In an extraordinary meeting, the Supervisory Board
ap­­­proved the application of S-Bahn Berlin GmbH to provide
a service to a subnetwork of the S-Bahn (metro) Berlin on
its own.
The Supervisory Board furthermore was briefed about
important individual items, such as a railway accident and
decisions about closing maintenance facilities.
In December, the Supervisory Board approved DB Group’s
budget and capital expenditures planning for the 2015
financial year.

DB ML AG
The Supervisory Board of DB ML AG was involved in all
decisions of fundamental significance for DB ML AG.
In the year under review, the Supervisory Board of
DB ML AG met for four ordinary meetings, one extraordinary
meeting and one strategy meeting. One Supervisory Board
member fully participated in less than half of the meetings
held in the year under review. No resolutions were adopted

as significant capital expenditures, equity investment and
divestment projects. The Supervisory Board also discussed
the strategy of DB ML Group and of the major business units

MEETINGS OF THE SUPERVISORY
BOARD COMMITTEES
DB AG
The Supervisory Board of DB AG has established four permanent committees to facilitate its work efficiently. The
Supervisory Board’s Executive Committee met five times
in the year under review and was in regular contact with
the Management Board regarding all major business policy
issues. In its meetings, it focused in particular on preparing
the focal topics for each of the Supervisory Board meetings.
The Audit and Compliance Committee met six times
during the year under review, addressing, in particular, the
Group’s current financial situation and individual business
units, the quarterly and half-year financial statements, the
review findings concerning these, and the half-yearly
review of major capital expenditures projects. The Audit
and Compliance Committee discussed the continuation of
the major Stuttgart 21 project and the progress of costs
associated with the project. Furthermore, it addressed
changes to internal risk reporting, updates in corporate
governance as well as changes to the internal controlling
system necessitated by the German Accounting Law

Modernization Act (BilMoG). The Audit and Compliance
Commit­­tee also received regular information on compliancerelated investigations and internal audit findings. In addition, the committee discussed the hiring of an auditor for
the financial statements and the progress of the auditing
process. Moreover, the committee dealt with the economic
development of acquisitions and was informed in detail
about economically significant individual items. The
Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee was in
regular contact with the Chief Financial Officer and the
external auditor, and reported regularly and in detail on the
committee’s work to the full Supervisory Board.
The Personnel Committee met five times in the year
under review to prepare Management Board-related matters
for discussion by the Supervisory Board. The committee
prepared data especially concerning the Management Board
members’ performance target attainment for 2013 and the
Management Board’s performance target agreements for
the year under review. The comparison of the appropriateness of the remuneration of Management Board members,
completed during the year under review, was also discussed.
The Mediation Committee established in accordance
with section 27 (3) of the German Co-Determination Act
(MitbestG) did not have occasion to meet in the year under
review.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
During the year under review, the Management Boards and
Supervisory Boards of DB AG and DB ML AG again considered the further development of corporate governance. In
a Cabinet decision on July 1, 2009, the German Federal Government adopted the Public Corporate Governance Code.
The Public Corporate Governance Code outlines key provisions of applicable law governing the management and
supervision of unlisted companies in which the German
Federal Government holds a majority stake, and sets forth
internationally and nationally recognized standards for
proper and responsible corporate governance. The Supervisory Boards of DB AG and DB ML AG dealt with the application
of the Public Corporate Governance Code within DB Group
and DB ML Group and adopted the necessary resolutions.

Compliance with recommendations of the Public Corporate Governance Code with one exception

Corporate governance rules are intended to ensure good,
responsible, value-focused company management. On July 1,
2009, the German Federal Government adopted the Public
Corporate Governance Code (PCGK) regulating the principles of good corporate and investment management. The
PCGK sets out the essential provisions of applicable law
governing the management and monitoring of non-listed
companies in which the Federal Republic of Germany holds
a majority stake, while outlining the internationally and
nationally acknowledged principles of good and responsible corporate governance. The objective of the PCGK is
to make the management and oversight of companies more
transparent and easier to understand as well as to establish
more precisely the role of the Federal Government as a
shareholder in such companies. Concurrently, the intention
is to increase awareness of good corporate governance.
We are convinced that good corporate governance is
fundamental to the success of DB Group. Our aim is to sustainably increase the value of the company so as to promote
the interests of customers, business partners, investors,
employees and the public, while maintaining and expanding
trust in DB Group.

Statement of compliance
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board of
DB AG hereby issue the following joint statement: “Since the
last statement of compliance was published on March 26,
2014, DB AG has complied with the recommendations
adopted by the Federal Government on July 1, 2009, concerning the PCGK, with the exception of point 3.3.2 (the
insurance deductible when taking out D&O liability insurance for the Supervisory Board). DB AG will continue to
comply with the regulations with the exception mentioned
above in the future, until a decision is reached concerning
deductibles for the Supervisory Board.
One Supervisory Board member appointed at the instigation of the Federal Government exceeded the recommended number of a total of three memberships of supervisory bodies at one time, in non-compliance with point 5.2.1
(2) of the PCGK, when he resigned in January 2014. This
exceeding of recommendations was based on organizational and functional reasons that can be attributed to the
Federal Government. The Supervisory Board member was

not prevented from fulfilling his duties as a member of the
Group’s Supervisory Board because of this, as the Supervisory Board member had sufficient time to exercise his roles
within DB AG.”
A statement of compliance was also issued by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of DB ML AG for
DB ML AG with the same exceptions.
DB AG and DB ML AG intend to continue to comply with
the other recommendations of the PCGK in future.

Cooperation between the Management
Board and Supervisory Board
As a German Aktiengesellschaft (joint stock corporation),
DB AG and DB ML AG are subject to a two-tier management
and monitoring structure in the form of the Management
Board and Supervisory Board. These two bodies are strictly
segregated in terms of both their membership and their
competencies. The Management Board is solely responsible for managing the company. The Supervisory Board
monitors the activities of the Management Board and is
responsible for appointing members to, and dismissing
members from, the Management Board.
In the interests of optimum company management, we
see it as very important for the Management Board and the
Supervisory Board to maintain continuous dialog with each
other and to work together efficiently and in an atmosphere
of mutual trust for the benefit of the company. The Management Board provides the Supervisory Board with regular,
prompt, comprehensive information on all matters relevant
to the company, particularly those concerning planning,
business development, the risk position and risk management, as well as the internal control system.
An overview of the members of the Management Board
and Supervisory Board [page 263 ff.] of DB AG, including the
mandates they hold, is provided in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management Board
The Management Board is solely responsible for managing
the company. It is required to safeguard the interests of the
company and is committed to achieving sustainable growth

41

42

Deutsche Bahn Group

2 0 1 4 i n t eg r at e d r e p o r t

of company value. It specifies the corporate objectives and
defines the strategies to be implemented in order to attain
these objectives. The Management Board is responsible for
making decisions on all matters of fundamental and key
importance for the company.
The Management Board of DB AG consists of six divisions. As well as the division of the CEO, the Management
Board also encompasses the following divisions: Finance/
Controlling, Human Resources, Technology and Environment, Infrastructure and Services as well as Compliance,
Privacy, Legal and Group Security.
The Management Board of DB ML AG consists of eight
divisions. As well as the division of the CEO, the Management Board also encompasses the following divisions:
Finance/Controlling, Human Resources, Passenger Transport, Transport and Logistics, Compliance, Privacy, Legal
and Group Security, Technology and Environment, as well
as Services.
The Management Board members must discuss any conflicts of interest with the Supervisory Board immediately
and must also notify their colleagues on the Management
Board of these. There were no conflicts of interest during
the year under review. In order to ensure integrated Group
management, the meetings of the Management Board of
DB AG are generally held jointly with those of the Management Board of DB ML AG.

Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Management Board in its management of the company.
In line with the requirements of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; MitbestG), the Supervisory Board of DB AG consists of 20 members, of whom ten
members are shareholders’ representatives and ten members are employee representatives. Some of the shareholders’ representatives are seconded to the Supervisory
Board and some are elected at the Annual General Meeting.
The employees’ representatives on the Supervisory Board
are elected in line with the requirements of the Co-Determination Act. There are currently three women serving on the
Supervisory Board of DB AG.
In line with the requirements of the German Co-Determination Act, the Supervisory Board of DB ML AG consists of
12 members, of whom six members are shareholders’ representatives and six are employee representatives. The
shareholders’ representatives are elected at the Annual
General Meeting. The employees’ representatives on the
Supervisory Board are elected in line with the requirements
of the Co-Determination Act. There are currently four women
serving on the Supervisory Board.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of DB AG and
DB ML AG is Professor Dr. Dr. Utz-Hellmuth Felcht. Personal
or business relationships [page 251] of the individual Supervisory Board members of each company are stated in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Supervisory Board members must discuss any conflicts of interest with the Supervisory Board immediately
and must also provide the Supervisory Board with information about any such conflicts. There were no conflicts of
interest during the year under review.
Transactions of fundamental importance and other Man­
­agement Board decisions with a major impact on the business activities and on the asset position, financial position
or profit situation of the company require the authorization
of the Supervisory Board. The Management Board reports
to the Supervisory Boards of DB AG and DB ML AG on the
development of business and the position of the Group at
least once every quarter. The Management Board also reports
to the Supervisory Board regularly on all measures implemented within the company that are intended to ensure
compliance with laws and corporate regulations (compliance). In addition to the auditing and approval of the company’s annual financial statements, the tasks of the Supervisory Board include auditing the company’s management
report, the consolidated financial statements, and the Group
management report. The Supervisory Board also monitors
the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal
control system, the risk management system, and the inter­
­nal revision system, as well as the process of auditing the
annual financial statements.
In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is in
regular contact with the Management Board and specifically the Chairman of the Management Board to discuss
company strategy, business development and risk management. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives reg­
­ular reports from the Chairman of the Management Board
on all events that are of key importance for assessing the
company’s situation and development, as well as for its
management.
There were no consultancy agreements or other comparable service agreements or contracts for services between
the members of the Supervisory Board and DB AG or between
the members of the Supervisory Board and DB ML AG in the
2014 financial year.
Joint Supervisory Board meetings

The Supervisory Board of DB AG and the Supervisory Board
of DB ML AG meet regularly with the aim of increasing the
efficiency of the consultation process. Resolutions of the
respective Supervisory Board are adopted by their members.
The possibility still exists for separate Supervisory Board
meetings to be held.

t o o u r s ta k e h o l d e r s

Supervisory Board committees

In order to enable the Supervisory Board to carry out its
monitoring activities to the best of its abilities, the Supervisory Boards of DB AG and DB ML AG have made use of the
option of setting up further committees in addition to the
Mediation Committee, which has to be set up in accordance
with the Co-Determination Act. The Supervisory Boards have
each created an Executive Committee, an Audit and Compliance Committee, and a Personnel Committee. A list of the
member s of these committees [page 265] can be found in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Supervisory Board reports on the work of the committees [page 37 f.]

in the year under review in its report. Details of the functions
of the individual committees Œ can be found on our Web site.

Transparency
All important information regarding the consolidated and
annual financial statements, the interim report, the financial
calendar and information on reportable security transactions
can be found on our Web site Œ . In addition, we provide
regular information on current developments within the
framework of our investor relations activities and corporate
communication.

Risk Management
Good management also encompasses a responsible approach
to the risks and opportunities arising in connection with
business operations. The early identification and limitation
of business risks is therefore of paramount importance to
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.
The Management Board is responsible for ensuring adequate risk management and monitoring this within the company, and for continuously improving both of these things.
The German Accounting Law Modernization Act (Gesetz zur
Modernisierung des Bilanzrechts; BilMoG) precisely defines
the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board with regard
to monitoring the accounting process and ensuring the
effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system. For the
Supervisory Board to be able to discharge this responsibility, it must be provided with suitable information based
on which it can form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems. Regular reports are made to the
Audit and Compliance Committee concerning the adequacy
and effectiveness of the internal control system. In addition, the Management Board reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding risks of major importance to

C o r p o r at e G o v e r n a n c e r e p o r t

the Group companies and the handling of these risks by the
Management Board. It also monitors whether the earlywarning risk management system complies with the requirements of section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz; AktG).

Compliance
Compliance is the foundation of the corporate and leadership culture in DB Group. To us, compliance means ensuring
our business activities comply with the relevant laws and
regulations that apply to them.
The compliance work of DB Group includes the early
detection of compliance risks as well as the introduction of
relevant countermeasures. This work includes conducting
compliance programs, constant communication and process improvements.
Additional information on the topic of compliance can
be found in our Compliance and Privacy Report [page 55 f.] or
on our Web site Œ.

Accounting and auditing
On March 26, 2014, the Annual General Meetings of DB AG
and DB ML AG appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktien­
gesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (P wC), Berlin,
as auditor for the 2014 financial year. The Audit and Compliance Committees prepared the proposals of the Supervisory Boards regarding the election of the auditor and, following the election of the auditor by the Annual General
Meeting, defined the key audit aspects in conjunction with
the auditor. Once again this year, it was agreed with the
auditor that the Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee will be notified of any possible reasons for exclusion
or prejudice that emerge in the course of the audit, if these
cannot be resolved immediately. It was also agreed that the
Chairman of the committee will be notified immediately by
the auditor of any separate findings and any irregularities
in the statement of compliance.

Efficiency audit of the
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the efficiency of
its activities. An efficiency audit is carried out every two
years. The last efficiency audit took place in 2013.

The compensation report outlines the compensation system
and lists the individual compensation of the members of
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.

Compensation system of the Management Board
The compensation system for the Management Board of
DB AG and DB ML AG aims to provide appropriate compensation to the Management Board members in accordance
with their duties and areas of responsibility, while at the
same time directly taking into account the performance of
each Management Board member and the success of the
company.
The appropriate level of compensation is reviewed regularly using a comparison process. This review examines
the level of Management Board compensation both in comparison to the external market (horizontal appropriateness)
and in comparison to other levels of compensation within
the company (vertical appropriateness). If the review shows
a need to adjust the compensation system or the level of
compensation, the Personnel Committee of the Supervisory
Board submits its proposals in this regard to the Supervisory
Board for approval. An audit of the appropriateness of the
compensation of Management Board members was completed during the year under review.

Compensation components
The total compensation for Management Board members
consists of fixed basic compensation, a performance-linked
annual director’s fee and a long-term incentive plan based
on multiyear figures. Total compensation also includes benefit commitments, other commitments and ancillary benefits.
Fixed basic compensation is cash compensation linked to
the financial year. It is based on the scope of responsibility
and the experience of each Management Board member.
The individually defined fixed income is paid out in 12 equal
installments.
The annual performance-linked director’s fee is calculated using a factor linked to the achievement of business
targets (director’s fee factor) and the achievement of individual targets (performance factor). There is a multiplicative link between the director’s fee factor and the performance factor. The director’s fee factor depends on the level
of success in attaining the business targets set out by corporate planning. The parameters for this relationship are
in equal parts operational success (operating income after
interest) and return on capital employed (ROCE).

The performance factor reflects success in meeting personal targets. The target fee corresponds to the annual
director’s fee paid to the Management Board member in a
“normal financial year” for fully meeting performance targets
(meeting targets). If company results do not meet planned
objectives, the director’s fee factor can, in extreme cases, be
reduced to zero, regardless of personal performance. This
means that the annual director’s fee can be zero. If planned
objectives are sufficiently exceeded and the maximum performance factor is also achieved, the annual director’s fee
can amount to 2.6 times the target director’s fee.
The business and personal targets of the Management
Board members are decided by the Supervisory Board each
year based on recommendations from the Personnel Committee, and are then agreed in writing with the Management
Board members.
Together with the corporate planning adopted by the
Supervisory Board, the personal targets form the basis for
assessing the annual director’s fee. This means that all of
the key parameters for total compensation are established
at the beginning of the financial year.
At the end of each financial year, the director’s fee and
the personal performance factor are calculated for each
Management Board member based on Group results. Target
income is attained if both Group and individual targets
have been met in full. The final decision on this matter is
made by the Supervisory Board and is prepared by the Personnel Committee.
The long-term incentive element is determined based
on the sustained increase in the value of the company. This
basis for calculation rewards the attainment and/or ex­­
ceeding of the operating profit targets included in the
medium-term planning and the effects of these on the company’s value. After the end of each planning period, the
increase in value achieved in comparison to the company’s
original planning and the payment amount are calculated.
A peer-group comparison is then used to adjust the payout
ratio of the long-term incentive to reflect the external performance of the company compared with a peer group. The
term of each plan is four years.
The payment amount for the long-term incentive plan
has an upper limit and can vary between 0% and 300%.
Claims from the long-term incentive plan are inheritable.

t o o u r s ta k e h o l d e r s

The Management Board members are entitled to an appropriate severance fee if their contract is terminated before
the stipulated termination date provided that the Management Board member was not personally responsible through
his or her actions for the termination. The severance fee is
based on the remaining term of the contract, the agreed
target salary and, where applicable, the pension benefits
already owed by DB AG or DB ML AG for the remainder of
the contract.
In accordance with the recommendations of the PCGK,
a severance fee cap is included in all contracts of members
of the Management Boards of DB AG and DB ML AG. This cap
means that payments made to a Management Board member
due to premature termination of Management Board duties
cannot, without good cause as defined by section 626 of
the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; BGB),
exceed the value of two years’ salary, including variable
compensation components, and must not provide compensation for more than the remaining term of the employment
agreement.
Management Board members do not receive any additional compensation for mandates exercised in control
bodies of Group companies or affiliated companies.
Pension entitlements

The Supervisory Boards of DB AG and of DB ML AG have set
a general retirement age of 65 for Management Board mem­
­bers. After leaving the company, Management Board members are entitled to pension payments. A Management Board
member is entitled to a lifelong pension if the term of
employment ends due to permanent invalidity, or if the
contract is terminated before the agreed termination date
or is not extended, where the Board member was not re­­
sponsible for the termination, or if the Management Board
member refuses to continue the contract under the same
or more beneficial conditions.
Company pension commitments are based on a percentage of base salary depending on the length of time that
the Management Board member has been with the company. Pension commitments include lifelong retirement and
surviving dependent benefits. There is no lump-sum payment option.
In addition to Management Board member contracts
entered into before January 1, 2009, a reinsurance policy
was concluded to cover company pension benefits.
Contractual ancillary benefits

The contractual ancillary benefits for members of the Management Board include a company car with driver for business and personal use, a personal BahnCard 100 First free
travel card and standard insurance coverage. A housing

C o r p o r at e G o v e r n a n c e r e p o r t

allowance is provided for second homes where these are
required for business purposes. Where these non-cash benefits cannot be granted on a tax-free basis, they are taxed
as non-monetary benefits for which the Management Board
members are fully responsible. Management Board members, like any other member of the Group’s executive staff,
can choose to take part in the company’s deferred compensation program.
The members of the Management Board are covered by
liability insurance against financial losses incurred due to
working for DB AG and/or DB ML AG (D&O insurance). In the
2014 financial year, this insurance was offered as a Group
insurance policy with a legally established deductible. It
provides coverage for potential financial losses that could
arise from carrying out Management Board activities. The
insurance cover of the existing D&O insurance policy is
valid for a period of five years after termination of activities
as a member of the Management Board.

The director’s fee for the previous financial year is due at

Compensation of the Supervisory Board
for the 2014 financial year
DB AG Supervisory Board

Compensation of the Supervisory Board of DB AG was most
recently regulated by the Annual General Meeting decision
of September 21, 2010. In addition to being reimbursed for
their cash outlays and the value-added tax due on their
compensation and cash outlays, the Supervisory Board mem­
­bers each receive a fixed annual compensation of € 20,000,
plus performance-linked annual compensation. The performance-based salary is calculated based on the relationship
between operating profit (EBIT) for the financial year compared to the previous year’s figures, and the attaining of
specific operational performance figures. Performancebased salary is limited to a maximum of € 13,000. The Chair­
­man of the Supervisory Board receives double this amount,

t o o u r s ta k e h o l d e r s

while his deputy receives one and a half times the above
figure. This compensation is increased by a quarter for every
position held on a committee by the individual Supervisory
Board member. Compensation increases by 100% for being
Chairman of the Executive Committee or the Audit and
Compliance Committee, and by 50% for being Chairman of
the Personnel Committee. This does not include membership or chairmanship of the committee that is re­­quired under
the terms of section 27 (3) of the MitbestG.
In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board of
DB AG receive an attendance fee of € 250 for each meeting
of the Supervisory Board and its committees at which they
are present. Supervisory Board members can also choose
between a personal BahnCard 100 First or five free train
tickets.
The members of the Supervisory Boards of both companies are covered by liability insurance against financial
losses incurred by risks arising from the business activities
of DB AG (D&O insurance). This insurance is designed as a
Group insurance policy with no deductible and provides
coverage for financial losses that may occur during the performance of Supervisory Board activities. There is also a
Group accident insurance policy in place for members of
the Supervisory Board. The relevant company pays the premiums for these policies.
Supervisory Board members who have only been members for part of the financial year in question receive a
twelfth of the total compensation (equivalent to the amount
payable per month) for each month or part of a month of
their membership. This rule also applies to the increase in
compensation for the Chairman of the Board and his or her
deputy and to the increase in compensation for membership and chairmanship of a Supervisory Board committee.
Payment takes place after the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting that votes to ratify the Supervisory Board’s
activities in the previous financial year.
Taxes due on compensation received, including the personal BahnCard 100 First or the five free train tickets, are the
individual responsibility of each Supervisory Board member.
Supervisory Board members currently hold no shares in
the company, nor do they hold options entitling them to
purchase shares in the company.
Subject to the approval of the activities of the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on March 18,
2015, the members of the Supervisory Board of DB AG will
receive the following compensation for their duties during
the year under review:

DB ML AG Supervisory Board

Compensation of the Supervisory Board of DB ML AG is set
out in Article 15 of the Articles of Association and was most
recently regulated by the Annual General Meeting decision
on September 21, 2010. In addition to being reimbursed for
their cash outlays and the value-added tax due on their
compensation and cash outlays, the Supervisory Board
members each receive fixed annual compensation of € 5,000.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives double
this amount, while his deputy receives one and a half times
the above figure. This compensation is increased by a quarter
for every position held on a Supervisory Board committee
and by half for each chairmanship of a committee. This does
not include membership or chairmanship of the committee
that is required under the terms of Section 27 (3) of the
MitbestG.
In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board of
DB ML AG receive an attendance fee of € 250 for each
meeting of the Supervisory Board and its committees at
which they are present.
The members of the Supervisory Boards of both companies are covered by liability insurance against financial
losses incurred by risks arising from the business activities
of DB ML AG (D&O insurance). This insurance is designed
as a Group insurance policy with no deductible and provides
coverage for financial losses that may occur during the performance of Supervisory Board activities. There is also a
Group accident insurance policy in place for members of the
Supervisory Boards of both companies. The relevant company pays the premiums for these policies.
Supervisory Board members who have only been members for part of the financial year in question receive a
twelfth of the total compensation (equivalent to the amount
payable per month) for each month or part of a month of
their membership. This rule also applies to the increase in
compensation for the Chairman of the Board and his or her
deputy and to the increase in compensation for membership and chairmanship of a Supervisory Board committee.
Payment takes place after the conclusion of the Annual

Stakeholder acceptance is an essential requirement for the
sustainable success of DB Group. This is why we cultivate
an open and collaborative exchange with all stakeholder
groups and take their interests seriously.
In the year under review we conducted the first comprehensive stakeholder survey, with several thousand respondents. The results formed the foundation for a systematic
materiality analysis [page 52 ff.] while simultaneously providing an impetus for numerous constructive follow-up
discussions. We have continued to rely on a broad spectrum

of dialog formats and platforms in this process. The third
DB Sustainability Day [page 51] was especially important; representatives of all stakeholder groups came together to
meet with the top management of DB Group. On this occasion, the targets and achievements of DB Group in the
dimensions of profitable market leader ≈, top employer †
and eco -pioneer ¥ were critically appraised, and the results
of the materiality analysis were used to provide stimuli for
strategy.

Guidelines for collaborative cooperation
DB Group relies on collaborative dialog and a trustworthy

relationship with all stakeholders based on integrity, continuity and transparency. We see this exchange as an opportunity to create understanding for our position while gaining
recognition and impetus for our sustainable and entrepreneurial business activities. Critical topics for which shared
solutions still need to be developed are a firm component of
this open exchange.
Our stakeholder charter forms the foundation for all
dialog activities. It articulates principles that apply Groupwide for responsible interactions between DB Group and its
stakeholders. This provides the foundation for including
stakeholders in the setting of important agendas, for ex­­
ample in noise reduction measures or the development or
introduction of product offers.

Public policy dialog follows clear rules
As one of the largest mobility and logistics service providers, DB Group is subject like almost no other company to
public scrutiny and public policy. This is why we are a soughtafter dialog partner, especially in public debates. DB Group
takes stances on public policy issues related to transport
at the national and international level vis-a-vis political and
administrative institutions, parties, associations and scientific fields that are relevant for the company. DB Group
seeks to contribute to a constructive opinion-forming process with objective arguments. The principles of the Stakeholder Charter also apply to our dialog on matters of public
policy. Furthermore, DB Group has established strict inter­
­nal standards for participation in political processes; these
are summarized in the “Group Principles – Ethics – Code of
Conduct” and compliance is mandatory Group-wide.

Our committees
DB Advisory Board active since 2002

In 2002, DB Group’s Management Board established the DB
Advisory Board to provide independent counsel for public
debates and to position the corporation. The Advisory Board
is comprised of 12 renowned individuals from the fields of
science and business. The members are independent and
do not represent the institutions at which they work. Prof.
Dr. Dr. h. c. Gerd Aberle has been Chairman of the Advisory

Board since 2008. DB Advisory Boardʼs task is to challenge
and question DB Groupʼs positions and then to discuss their
findings with the Management Board, as well as to support
dialog between DB Group and experts. The members meet
at least four times a year for this purpose. The DB Advisory
Board has no duties in the sense of stock corporation law.
During the year under review, the DB Advisory Board
focused especially on the following topics: the energy transition and our role as an eco-pioneer, technology strategy,
communications and customer dialog, digitalization, collective bargaining negotiations and infrastructure financing.
A complete list of the members of the DB Advisory Board Œ
is available online.
Ten years of the DB Passenger Advisory Board

How can we increase customer satisfaction and establish
long-term customer loyalty? How can we more strongly
integrate customers into the company, learn more about
what customers want, and more effectively utilize customer suggestions? These considerations led us in 2004 to
be the first major company in Germany to establish a Passenger Advisory Board. The response from customers was
enormous: the first invitation resulted in 5,400 passengers
responding with interest in being involved with DB Group.
Since its founding, the Advisory Board has held 20 meetings, provided several valuable initiatives and set numerous
measures into action. The Passenger Advisory Board consists of 30 voluntary members who are appointed for threeyear terms and who come from important customer groups
in regional and long-distance transport. The Advisory Board
meets twice a year at ordinary meetings while also providing support and advice on numerous projects that are
relevant to customers. During the year under review, the
focus of our shared work was on improving passenger information throughout the entire travel chain, inclusion in topics
such as vehicles and products, as well as the development
of sustainable ideas for designing interlinked mobility. In a
workshop on MATERIALITY ANALYSIS [page 52 ff.], representatives from the Passenger Advisory Board also discussed in
the year under review the results of the Stakeholder Survey
and provided specific initiatives for the associated action
recommendations.

Material activities in 2014
Third DB Sustainability Day

A good tr adition:
DB top management meets
with stakeholder s

≈†¥
The DB Sustainability Day is a
platform for direct exchange
with our partners in public
policy, industry, the workforce,
organizations, investors,
suppliers and customers.

In mid-November, around 140
representatives of all stakeholder groups came to the third
DB Sustainability Day to discuss
such issues as the results and
conclusions of the Materiality
Analysis [page 52 ff.]. The Sus­­tain­
­ability Day serves as a way to
take stock of where we are and
to assess our performance.
The previously conducted
stakeholder survey [page 52 ff.]

formed the foundation for the
third Sustainability Day, which
is traditionally a direct exchange
with high-ranking representatives of all stakeholders, led by
the DB Management Board and other top managers. Statements were integrated into a materiality matrix that was
discussed intensively in forums and became more concrete.
An essential result of this process was that the majority of
the participants in attendance approved the matrix in
terms of content.

At the fourth DB Sustainability Day, we will report on the
implementation of the proposals developed during the
third Sustainability Day, as well as our further progress on
strategy.

Materiality Analysis
The DB2020
strategy raises our ambitions regarding the
integration of individual stakeholder groups. In order to
consider their perspectives on DB Group in a systematic
way, we conducted our first comprehensive stakeholder
survey in the year under review.
The survey provided a basis for creating a Group-wide
materiality matrix, from which we will develop central topics
and action areas for the sustainable success of DB Group.
The results were also the guiding theme of the third DB Sustainability Day [page 51]. With this multi-level procedure, we
have initiated a broad discussion with all stakeholder groups
and within DB Group about the important topics of today
and tomorrow, and we will continue this conversation in
many ways.

The survey process

>>Selection of the surveyed 33 thematic fields by

DB Group’s

including various stakeholder representatives. All 33 topics are relevant for DB Group.
Online survey of about 3,400 stakeholders with a request
to prioritize the thematic fields and assess DB Group’s
performance (stakeholder perspective).
The DB Executive Board also prioritized the topics
(DB per­­spective).
The stakeholder survey and the survey of the Executive
Board therefore form the foundation for DB Group’s
first materiality analysis.
Evaluation based on the top-two method. Information in
the materiality matrix shows what percentage of survey
respondents have classified a topic as having extraordinarily high or very high importance.
The evaluation focused on commonalities and differences between the stakeholders perspective and the
DB perspective.

>>Stakeholders and/or DB top management rated 15 thematic fields as having very high importance and the other
18 topics were considered of middle to low importance.
The shared top themes are those related to customers.
Among these: punctuality, customer satisfaction, custo­
­mer/transport information, price-performance ratio and
product quality.
Stakeholders and DB perspectives valued a high-performance infrastructure, employee satisfaction and interlinked mobility as very important.

Assessment of performance

Topics with very high importance, such as customer topics,
high-performance infrastructure, interlinked mobility and
employee satisfaction, were given the lowest performance
levels by both sides.
The stakeholder perspective assigns a low performance
rating to the topics of nationwide offerings, citizen participation, innovation driver among suppliers, open infrastructure access, employer image and consideration of
demographics.
Stakeholders gave the highest performance marks for
en­­­vironmental topics, the prevention of corruption, train­
­ing and professional development, corporate social re­­
sponsibility and dealing with regulations.
Stakeholders generally assign high social acceptance to
DB Group: 80% believe that DB Group provides an indispensable contribution to the population and the economy.
About 55% agreed with the statement that DB Group
takes on responsibility in society and is a credible and
reliable partner.
Stakeholders perceived room for improvement in stakeholder dialog performance: two-thirds of all stakeholders
believe that DB Group’s decision-making processes are
not transparent enough and they do not feel included.

Overall, the difference between the perspectives of stakeholders and DB Group with regard to performance evaluation are less than those for the rating of importance. There
is very high agreement between both perspectives.
The most significant deviations in performance evaluation occurred in the topics of open infrastructure access,
comprehensive offerings, climate protection, environmentally friendly energy mix and innovative products.

With the exception of the innovative product topic, stakeholders delivered a consistently worse evaluation than did
DB top management.
The opposite was the case for the topics of profitability,
corporate social responsibility, interlinked mobility and
product quality; stakeholders ranked performance noticeably better than DB top management.

Important survey results
The results of the stakeholder survey fundamentally affirm
the path we have chosen with the DB2020
strategy. The
results provide us with a yardstick that we can use constantly to improve our performance in all dimensions.
In the economic ≈ dimension we have a major need for
action:
Customer and quality ¿ : There is definitely room for im­­
provement here. In the year under review we implemented and initiated numerous measures [page 93 f.] and
planned more for 2015 [page 181 f.]. DB Group also affirms
its responsibility for a high-performance infrastructure,
which is documented in its agreement to the ambitious
quality targets in the LuFV II [page 89]. We must get better
at the planning and execution of construction measures
as well as maintaining infrastructure.
Profitable growth Æ : The central challenge here is to
make the importance of economic topics clearer to stake­
­holders. DB AG is organized as a private company and
has to pay attention to profitability and financial stability. Profits are also an essential basis for the ability
to make capital expenditures and therefore to secure
the company’s future. We must communicate this more
intensively.
In the social † dimension, our strategic approach was
affirmed by the rating of importance and performance in
employee satisfaction, demographics and employer image.
In the environmental ¥ dimension, we want to further
con­­solidate our solid position in environmental issues
(medium importance, high performance) with stakeholders.
In addition, DB Group wants to become more transparent in stakeholder dialog and more intensively incorporate stakeholders where there is enough decision-making
latitude to do so. The implementation of these conclusions
began already at the third DB Sustainability Day. We will
continue to intensify and substantiate our dialog with our
stakeholders in 2015.

Compliance
Compliance is the foundation of the corporate and leadership culture in DB Group. To us, compliance means ensuring
our business activities comply with the relevant laws and
regulations that apply to them.
DB Group’s compliance activities focus on preventing
corruption and other corporate crime, as well as the consistent fight to combat it. Mandatory compliance policies
serve to protect the company, our employees and our executives. Raising the awareness of our employees and executives remains very important. Only employees who are
aware of risks can recognize and also successfully avoid or
at least reduce them.
The Audit and Compliance Committee (PCA) of the
Super­­visory Board has supported compliance as a key topic
for the monitoring of the internal control system. In 2014,
we again expanded the number of subsidiaries inspected
during the course of the internal corporate audits carried
out under DB Group’s compliance management system.

As part of DB Group’s compliance management system,
the compliance risk atlas provides an overview of compliance risks in our business activities. The risk atlas includes
and documents all of the results of compliance activities in
the relevant year under review, for example the results of
deep risk analyses, process analyses or consulting work
related to compliance.

Further develop compliance of business partners
Successful lasting business operations require the careful
selection of business partners and suppliers who must then
be informed of DB Group values and commit to collaboration based on shared values. E-learning for business partners Œ fulfills this purpose, among others.

Whistle-blowing management in DB Group
In DB Group, the Group Works Agreement governs whistleblowing management and the Group Committee of Executive Representatives Agreement regulates how to deal with
incoming whistle-blowing reports. On the one hand, the
processes implemented by DB Group protect a whistleblower; on the other hand, this policy also considers the
interests of the person affected by allegations by setting
clearly defined requirements for the conclusiveness and
materiality of a whistle-blowing report.
Whistle-blowers have several ways to deliver a report: the
electronic Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS) for
whistle-blowing, which can be used in seven languages;
three ombudspersons who, as attorneys, are legally sworn
to attorney-client confidentiality; and the Whistle-blowing
Team at DB Group.

Trade compliance
The year under review saw intense consulting and expert
support for projects by various DB companies in foreign
trade law. This process took potential risks into account,
such as those that could arise from international developments such as the Russia/Ukraine crisis.

Focus on compliance with antitrust law
Executives and employees are made aware of the topic of
cartels in ongoing DB Group-wide in-person training events.
The training style is customized according to the requirements of the business units or Group functions. The target
group is all executives and employees of DB Group who
have contact with competitors or hold positions that are
relevant for competition. DB Schenker Logistics updated
their cartel law e-learning program during the year under
review, which uses case studies drawn from specific business units to illuminate the critical regulations governing
cartel law.

System for prevention of damages
from cartels in force

Customer privacy – advice on innovation trends and
partner in conquering new sales markets

DB Group’s Cartel Damage Prevention System (KSPS) went

Customer privacy dealt with the increasing digitalization of
consumption and mobility behaviors, such as the design of
new digital interfaces to customers (Web sites, apps) and
new trends in social media marketing. Another consulting
priority included the use of video surveillance in DB Group’s
trains and buildings.

into force on January 1, 2014. The system aims to minimize
the risk of DB Group becoming the victim of anticompetitive
agreements and to react quickly and effectively in cases
where anticompetitive acts by suppliers are suspected. The
KSPS employs a three-stage approach. Risks of anticompetitive practices for procurement are identified; purchasing
agents are made aware of the risks of anticompetitive practices in procurement procedures in a training program de­­
signed specifically for cartel risks; and finally, relevant risks
are evaluated and classified. These risks are minimized with
targeted defensive measures.

Privacy
The privacy organization in DB Group stands for compliance
with the personal rights of customers, employees, and business partners. DB Group has reached an exemplary, innovative and sustainable level of privacy through a mix of measures including advising, awareness-raising, monitoring
and development of national and international standards.

Awareness-raising and training
Along with raising awareness through communication and
awareness measures, target-group-specific training sessions were conducted for employees to expand their knowledge about topics related to privacy. Another priority in
the year under review was further training for employees
in the privacy organization.

Sustainable employee privacy
The year under review also saw the privacy organization
make considerable contributions to concluding privacyrelated works council agreements. Technological developments, such as mobile end devices and security technology,
played a major role in consultation activities. Another im­­
portant topic in the year under review was the consideration
of privacy concerns in the Group-wide employee survey.

International privacy expanded
International privacy topics during the year under review
included project-specific consulting, such as conducting the
second global employee survey and the implementation of
a uniform Group-wide personnel master data system.

Structured and systematic risk management
Services providers inside and outside of DB Group continued
their continuous, systematic audits in the year under review.
The re-auditing of the central systems that process customer and employee data also began. The audit concept is
constantly being adjusted to match the development of
international Group standards in privacy.

Privacy as an element of corporate culture
The Privacy Advisory Board worked throughout the year
under review on major and current privacy-related procedures in DB Group. One aim of the Privacy Advisory Board’s
work is to provide appropriate initiatives to the Management Board that shape privacy at DB Group in an exemplary and future-proof way, including the development of
recommendations for action for the privacy organization.
During the year under review, the Privacy Advisory Board
advocated the systematic strengthening of privacy in
DB Group by means of a process-related, organizational
embedding for corporate decisions relevant to privacy. The
Privacy Advisory Board also emphasized the importance of
privacy as a component of the corporate culture and in the
context of debates about values. The work of the advisory
board is moreover an important contribution to our stakeholder management [page 49 ff.] in the sense of the sustainability approach.

There are central topics in the 2014 Integrated Report that
constitute a common thread running through the many
sections of the report. Usually these topics come from the
DB trend landscape and have effects and even opportunities
and risks associated with them. Out of the entirety of topics,
we have selected five strategically important topics to
focus on and marked them in this report with the symbol ∫.
A summarized overview of the focus topics Œ is available
online.
∫

Focus topic 1: demographic development

Competition to attract qualified specialists and changes in
mobility requirements are major effects of demographic
change that affect DB Group.
∫

Focus topic 2: climate change

The number and intensity of extreme weather events continues to grow. In order to fulfill our claim as an eco-pioneer,
we are reducing our CO₂ emissions and meeting the challenges of climate change head-on.
∫

Focus topic 3: high-performance infrastructure

The existing network is essential for the quality and the
exploitation of growth opportunities in rail transport in
Germany. We were able to secure financing together with
the Federal Government up to 2019.
∫

Focus topic 4: growth at DB Schenker Rail

We expect growth potential in rail freight transport, especially in combined traffic and in the European market. To
tap this potential, we are expanding our European network
and focusing on growth industries.
∫

Focus topic 5: future mobility

We are expecting fundamental changes in the mobility
market, driven by trends such as digital life and intelligent
simplicity. We are preparing for this with the initiative
Mobility 4.0 [page 2 4 ff.] , among others.

In terms of passenger transport, we transport 12 million
people each day on our trains and buses. In the area of
transport and logistics, around 330 million t of goods are
transported by rail and around 99 million shipments by
road each year via our European network. More than 1.1
million t of air freight and just under 2.0 million TEUs of
ocean freight are processed in our global networks. We
operate the longest rail network in Europe, at around
33,000 km in length. We are also the fifth-largest energy
provider in Germany.
‡ Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) has been a joint stock
corporation in accordance with German law since it was
founded in 1994. Accordingly, it has a dual management and
controlling structure comprising a Management Board and
Supervisory Board. It is wholly owned by the Federal Republic
of Germany (Federal Government). Within DB Group, DB AG
manages the Infrastructure division with its business units
DB Netze Track, DB Netze Stations and DB Netze Energy

Deutsche Bahn Group (DB Group) is an international provider of mobility and logistics services operating globally
in more than 130 countries. Its headquarters are in Berlin.
DB Group has more than 300,000 employees, with just over
a third of these abroad. DB Group already occupies leading
positions in Europe and globally today. We want to be the
world’s leading mobility and logistics company by 2020.
We are designing and operating the transport networks
of the future. By integrating transport and the railway
infrastructure, as well as using smart economic and environmental networking of all types of transport, we move
both people and goods.

directly. The remaining six business units are consolidated
under the management of the wholly owned subsidiary DB
Mobility Logistics AG (DB ML AG). Within DB Group, DB AG
and DB ML AG both function as operational management
holding companies. The DB AG and DB ML AG Board divisions
are largely occupied by the same people (in dual roles).
DB Group’s business portfolio includes nine business
units. These are allocated to the three operating divisions
of Passenger Transport, Transport and Logistics as well as
Infrastructure and Services and are managed on an integrated basis. The structure is completed by the central
Group and service functions (including Legal, Strategy,
Controlling, Treasury and DB Environment). Their services
are provided by DB AG or by DB ML AG. This is also complying with the unbundling requirements according to the
European and national law. Accordingly the infrastructure
companies are separate entities with separate balance
sheets, profit and loss accounts and accounting systems.
There is also a so-called functional unbundling which guarantees independent decisions of DB Netz AG on infrastructure access and charges.
∫ The Infrastructure business units act as commercial
enterprises. Reliability and stability provide proof of the
high quality of the infrastructure. Programs such as “Future
Infrastructure” are aimed at ensuring that performance
pledges, deadlines and costs are met in operations and for
construction projects. Specific customer requirements are
also made possible through targeted adaptation of the
infrastructure, including with the use of own funds.
The essential cornerstones for profitable business are
sustainable financing of the existing infrastructure and ex­­
pansion of this in line with needs. Completion of the second
performance and financing agreement [page 89] plays a crucial role in securing maintenance of the existing network.

Group management report.

Service and financial relationships in DB Group
Within DB Group, because of strong operative interconnections and dependencies, there are service and financial
relationships between the holding companies and the individual business units, as well as between business units.
These can be organized into four groups:
Operational service relationships between two companies, which may arise through the use of infrastructure,
such as when DB Regio AG uses the rail network of
DB Netz AG, for which it pays train-path usage charges.
Service relationships due to Group and service functions:
the two management holdings DB AG and DB ML AG are
responsible for providing services for the operating
companies such as central purchasing, which organizes
and controls the procurement process for trains.
Group financing: the two management holdings perform
and consolidate the financing function in DB Group. In
this context, DB AG taps the capital markets through its
financing subsidiary DB Finance [page 99 ff.] and transfers
these funds as loans to the Group companies.
Domination and profit and loss transfer agreements: in
Germany, domination and profit and loss transfer agreements are used for the formation of a fiscal unit that
allows companies to offset tax losses against profits. In
DB Group, the company ultimately subject to tax in
Germany is DB AG . This also reduces administration
costs, as only DB AG is required to complete tax returns
in Germany, meaning that the tax authorities have only
one point of contact and can conduct comprehensive
audits.
The “at arm’s length” principle serves as the fundamental
characteristic of the development of service relationships.
This means that the compensation is always oriented to
market prices. In DB Group, this applies to operational service relationships, service functions and Group financing.
For example, DB Group-internal customers pay exactly the
same prices for utilization of train-paths as DB Groupexternal customers. The prices for intra-DB Group purchased
services are reviewed regularly on the basis of analyses to
ensure that prices are in line with the market. The terms of
financing transactions are based on prevailing market conditions in the finance and capital markets.

Payment is relinquished entirely if services are not directly
attributable. This applies in particular to group and service
functions [page 61] .
The reasons and motivation for aligning the costs of
service relationships in DB Group with market conditions
are as follows:
A value-based corporate management approach can only
be achieved if it is embedded at all levels in DB Group.
This, in turn, can only be achieved on the basis of fair
market conditions. Success and failure must be transparent in order to facilitate economic control.
Performance-based remuneration for employees and
management also takes place at the company level and
is therefore dependent on the conditions pertaining to
service relationships. Incentives must be based on trans­
­parent and fair conditions.
The infrastructure companies are legally required to
provide their services without discrimination. The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur; BNetzA) as­­
­sesses whether prices are in line with the market. Prices
are transparent for everyone.
Alignment of service relationships with market conditions is also both necessary and required for tax reasons
or from the perspective of minority shareholders.

>>

>>

>>

>>

The effects of domination and profit and loss transfer agree­
­ments within DB Group on profits and payments are not
qualified as service relationships, but are a consequence of
DB Group’s status as a domestic contract Group and the
associated rights and obligations of all the incorporated
domestic companies.

Operational service relationships
The most extensive operational service relationships arise
from the use of the rail infrastructure and the procurement
of energy from DB Netze Energy. Charges for the use of infra­
­structure are based on the corresponding pricing systems
for non-DB Group customers (train-path pricing system,
facility pricing system and station pricing system). This in­­
cludes purchasing of traction energy (diesel fuel and traction current) as well as electricity for stationary facilities
(such as switch heaters and train preheating systems).
The main effects from the intra-Group settlement of
service relationships between the various DB Group business units for services rendered in infrastructure are illustrated in the table on the next page.

Other operational service relationships result from the consolidation of service functions (DB Bahn Sales and DB Services) in the broader sense for the purpose of concentrating
expertise and increasing efficiency and productivity. In the
infrastructure area, DB Netze Projects carries out planning
and project management for the DB Netze Track, DB Netze
Stations and DB Netze Energy business units.

Service relationships due to Group
and service functions
The two management holdings DB AG and DB ML AG incorporate various Group and service functions [page 61] that,
apart from a few regulatory exceptions, perform functions
for the entire DB Group. The costs for Group functions are

not transferred to the business units (no “Group charges”).
Expenses for service functions are only charged if these
result from direct service relationships with the business
units or expenditures that are directly attributable to a tan­
­gible service. This applies in particular to transferal of real
estate, central purchasing and technology services, insurance
provisions consolidated centrally, as well as the separate al­­
location of costs for DB ML Group’s use of trademarks.
In order to prevent distortions or arbitrary demands for
payment, the costs of services rendered are borne by the
respective holding companies and not passed on. This means
that Group business units pay no Group charges for these
services.

The Group job market performs an important central function. DB JobService and the agency staff unit DB Temporary
Work ensure efficient deployment of personnel within the
Group job market and regulate measures for incentives to
employment.

Group financing
The Group Treasury [page 99] at DB AG is responsible for
DB Group financing. The Treasury operates throughout
DB Group as an in-house bank, although it provides a service function rather than acting as a profit center. All Group
companies have business relationships with the Treasury.
DB ML Group’s business is separated from that of DB Group’s
infrastructure companies. It predominantly involves the
borrowing and investment of financial re­­sources and the
pooling of liquidity. Treasury transactions are conducted at
fair market rates, meaning that the agreed interest rates
are in line with the rates quoted by banks when not intended
to yield a profit.

Fair market rates mean that the credit margins are adjusted
in line with the creditworthiness. The credit margin for the
infrastructure companies is largely in line with the credit

Profit and loss transfer and domination agreements
Profit transferred and losses offset do not constitute service relationships. On the contrary, the profit and loss
trans­­fer agreement stipulates that the amount of profit
distributed or the amount required to offset losses is not
reset every year but is calculated automatically. The flow of
capital is based on the shareholder’s right to profits or obli­

DB Group

­ ation to compensate losses. Regardless of this, DB Group
g
ensures that all Group companies have sufficient capital
stock despite the obligation to offset potential losses generated by other companies within the Group.
With regard to financial relationships, it is important to
note that interest payments and profit and loss transfers
are based on economically viable decisions and are necessary for funding capital expenditures. Investors are only
willing to provide capital if amortization and returns are
guaranteed. A purely debt-based financing model is not
commercially viable and is associated with high risks.

Profits are essential for maintaining DB Group’s capital ex­­
penditure capacity. Profits generated are either retained or
distributed to the sole shareholder, the Federal Government.
The share of profit retained in the company increases the

Business model
The r ail system in Germany [PAGE 59] is an essential part of
DB Group’s business activities. Since the beginning of the
new millennium, we have also gradually expanded our business portfolio in order to meet our customers’ needs more
effectively and respond to new market demands.
Today, our passenger transport business activities are
more broadly diversified. They comprise not only bus and
rail transport, but also intelligent linkage with other modes
of transport. Furthermore, we have business operations
throughout Europe that enable us to benefit from increasing
market potential in opening bus and rail transport markets.
Our business activities in the transport and logistics
area are based on an international platform from very early
on. DB Schenker Logistics and DB Schenker Rail are active
first and foremost in the business-to-business segment.
The customer base is widely spread in both business units.
It covers predominantly the automotive, chemical, industrial and commercial goods, high tech/electronics, consumer goods, health care, iron, coal and steel (montan),

building materials and steel industries. In our market penetration and product development activities, we attach
great importance to industry-specific solutions for comprehensive logistics services and multimodal products. This
way we strengthen synergies between our networks and
are able to offer high-quality logistics solutions to internationally active companies and to develop synergies between
transport networks in the interest of our customers.
Operating transport networks often necessitates a high
level of capital commitment, long investment cycles and
distinct fixed-cost structures. In this respect, achieving
optimal capacity utilization of our networks and systematically developing, integrating and cost-effectively operating these networks with efficient use of resources are
extremely important to DB Group’s economic development.
Increasing volumes in our networks not only lead to economies of scale in terms of costs, but also generally improves
the quality of service for the customers with increased service frequencies, and shorter travel and transport times.
Our leading market positions are an important success
factor for customer satisfaction and profitability.
We use operating performance data to measure capacity
utilization in our networks and our relative market shares
in the transport markets. In order to determine a relative
return, we calculate ratios comparing performance data
with the generated revenues (specific revenues).
DB Group has an effective business model through the
interlocking of the Passenger Transport, Transport and
Logistics as well as Infrastructure divisions. This allows
DB Group to offer services from one single source and
means that it operates successfully in all segments of the
transport market with its national and international services.
The four key success factors in the positive development
of DB Group which are a central component in DB Group’s
business model are as follows:
Entrepreneurial approach: in the course of the rail reform,
DB Group has established itself as a commercial enterprise. Particularly worth mentioning in this context are
the establishment of a modern and efficient organization
and a value-based management approach with the
target of capital market viability.
Integrated Group: as a system integrator in Germany,
DB Group optimizes the wheel-rail system. In doing so,
it serves as an important driving force for technological
innovation. The integrated Group structure enables us
to achieve positive synergies and align our infrastructure
to support efficiency, market orientation and profitability.

Passenger transport

Infrastructure

In passenger transport, our objective is to maintain our
strong market position in Germany in the long term while
growing in Europe. With our DB Bahn Long-Distance [page 124 ff.]
and DB Bahn Regional [page 1 28 ff.] business units, we are
extremely well-positioned in the German rail and bus transport markets.
Throughout Europe, transport contracts are being in­­
creasingly tendered in regional and urban transport. We
intend to profit from these as well in the future. Through
our DB Arriva [page 1 33 ff.] business unit, we are successfully
active in the regional bus and/or rail transport business in
14 European countries. This puts us in a good position for
continued growth.
The liberalization of the European passenger transport
markets is, however, progressing at different speeds across
Europe. Germany is at the forefront of liberalization of
national long­-distance rail passenger transport. In many
other countries, the national long-distance transport market
has not yet been opened to competition.

In Germany, we have assumed dual responsibility for rail
trans­­port as a result of our integrated Group structure: we are
both the operator and primary user of the rail infrastructure.
The resulting customer and efficiency focus in our in­­
frastructure serves all train operating companies without
discrimination. In addition to the Group’s internal code of
conduct, we ensure competitive neutrality of our rail infrastructure by means of regulation that is considered strict by
international standards. Our target is to continue to develop
the rail transport mode and thus strengthen the transport
infrastructure that is vital for Germany as a business location.
At the same time, we are laying the foundations for coping
with the increasing flow of traffic in Europe. We also take
care of both the rail network and passenger stations as well
as the power supply for the train operating companies in
Germany.

Transport and logistics

We strategically positioned ourselves as a leading transport and logistics service provider worldwide early on in
order to respond to current and future market demands.
We have dense networks in European rail freight and land
transport, global air and ocean freight transport, as well as
industry-specific expertise in global contract logistics.
Both of the business units DB Schenker R ail [page 1 39 ff.] and
DB Schenker Logistics [page 14 4 ff.] are managed in the Transport and Logistics division.
The demand for international logistics services is rising
due to increasing internationalization and the shift towards
cross-border production structures and flows of goods in
our customers’ markets. We meet these challenges with
integrated and branch-specific services and solutions.
By developing efficient and international logistics networks in land transport, we maintain contact with our customers and create new growth opportunities. The rail freight
transport business unit also benefits from this, such as
through intermodal transport chains and synergy effects.
We are safeguarding the future of rail freight transport
in Germany by integrating rail freight transport into highperformance, international logistics networks, thereby
opening up new opportunities for growth. The European
rail transport market has been completely open since 2007.
We serve all the important rail corridors within Europe and
have our own subsidiaries or partnerships in all relevant
countries.

Development of orders
In most of our business units, incoming orders are not a
relevant performance indicator and the majority of the
Group’s revenues are generated independently of long-term
contracts. The DB Bahn Regional and DB Arriva business
units are an exception to this rule, together accounting for
around 30% of total Group revenues. In these business units,
the development of orders in the form of long-term tr ansport contr acts [page 1 2 2 f.] entered into with Germany’s
Federal states and franchisers in other European countries
constitutes a key performance metric. There are also longterm contractual relationships with customers in the contract
logistics/SCM line of business in the DB Schenker Logistics
business unit, which generates around 5% of Group revenues.
Ticket sales in the DB Bahn Long-Distance business unit
generally generate immediate revenues that are received
within a short period of time.

In the DB Schenker Rail and DB Schenker Logistics business
units, framework contracts are also concluded with cus­
tom­­ers who have continuous demand for transport or both
trans­­port and logistics services.
Incoming orders in the DB Netze Track business unit are
generally related to train paths assigned to train operating
companies, whereby we make a distinction between scheduled and non-scheduled transport services.
The DB Netze Stations business unit has a similar structure. In this business unit, we conclude contracts with train
operating companies for station stops as well as long-term
contracts for leasing station space. The incoming orders in
the DB Netze Energy business unit pertain to energy purchased by train operating companies. The infrastructure
business units generate most of their revenues with intraGroup customers.
Services provided by the DB Services business unit are
likewise mainly purchased by intra-DB Group customers.

Responsibility and
social commitment

Ensuring a connection: Deutsche Bahn Foundation
provides solidarity with people on the fringes
of society

We have derived our responsibility for social affairs and the
environment from DB Group’s close links with Germany’s
social and economic development. At the beginning of 2013
we founded the Deutsche Bahn Foundation Œ as a non-profit
organization. The DB Museum Œ , including its three locations in Nuremberg, Koblenz and Halle (Saale), has been
incorporated into the Deutsche Bahn Foundation. Up to
0.5% of the annual operating profit of DB Group will be
allocated to the foundation. Christina Rau has become the
foundation’s patron. After having founded the Deutsche
Bahn Foundation, DB Group itself continues to be committed to social projects such as Bahn apprentices against
hate and violence (Bahn Azubis gegen Hass und Gewalt),
where young employees work to combat xenophobia, rightwing extremism and discrimination.
We also promote the work of the more than 100 railway
station missions (Bahnhofsmissionen) in Germany. These
not only carry out social work and pastoring tasks, they
also provide help free of charge to people who have limited
mobility to get on and off and change trains and they
accompany children traveling alone as part of the “Kids on
Tour” program. The Bahnhofsmissionen reach more than two
million people each year. DB Group provides its premises in
stations rent-free for this purpose and supports employees
with free travel. The Bahnhofsmission is also the only institution that has the right to collect donations at stations.
Outside of Germany, we also cooperate in Great Britain
with the Youth Offending Service. Youth Offending Service
is a partnership between various institutions aimed at combating youth crime. DB Arriva provides support to young
offenders within the framework of reintegration projects at
DB Arriva Trains Wales stations.

Deutsche Bahn Foundation
The Deutsche Bahn Foundation works in a practical, highimpact and cooperative manner. This approach was set out
in the principles for the work of the foundation. The mission statement developed in the year under review guides
its conduct: it wants to help build a society in which people
take responsibility for themselves and for others. It encourages people to share their concerns and enables them to
become actively involved for this purpose. Three higherlevel targets were set out for this that guide the foundation’s conduct.

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation campaigns for people in
emergencies and supports projects that help people to gain
or to regain a livelihood.
The Berlin city mission Œ (Berliner Stadtmission) receives
support in running a clinic for homeless people. Thanks to
the financial support, the clinic was able to stay open two
days per week through the whole of the year under review.
The mobile case helper project (Mobilen Einsatzhelfer),
started in 2013 at Berlin’s Zoo Station, could be continued
with assistance from the Deutsche Bahn Foundation. The
street social workers have since been working throughout
Berlin in order to help people who are unable to help themselves and cannot cope, as well as the homeless. The work
of the City Station Berlin was secured through a one-off
donation from the Deutsche Bahn Foundation in the year
under review. The target of the deacon’s institution is to
motivate and support homeless people on the road towards
an independent life in the community.
Up to 2,500 children and young people end up on the
streets every year. Providing these youngsters with a new life
perspective is the target of the Off Road Kids Foundation Œ .
The Deutsche Bahn Foundation has provided nine trans­­
ferrable annual season tickets for the German rail network
to the street social workers allowing them to provide support to children on the streets all over Germany. Around 60
children from youth care homes took part in the DB Kids
Camp Œ vacation program which was organized in conjunction with the ORK Foundation in the year under review.
With support from DB Schenker, the Deutsche Bahn
Foundation is committed to providing ad hoc disaster aid
worldwide. A massive aid convoy from the organization
Luftfahrt ohne Grenzen e. V. Œ (aviation without borders)
received support in May 2014 following the flood disaster
in the Balkans. Ten DB Schenker trucks delivered more than
100 t of urgent humanitarian aid to the victims of the di­sas­
­ter, including in particular baby food and drinking water
along with blankets and hygiene goods. The Deutsche Bahn
Foundation also transported 276 tents and cooking units
valued at € 100,000 to the crisis and refugee areas of
Northern Iraq as part of a humanitarian aid convoy. The
Deutsche Bahn Foundation had the tents produced in
Ankara/Turkey. DB Schenker Arkas was responsible for their
transport.

Group management report

Creating links: Deutsche Bahn Foundation
overcomes barriers between people

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation campaigns to remove prejudices between people with the aim of integrating underprivileged people from everyday life. Their projects cover
issues that connect people from different parts of society
and create mutual understanding.
The “Depression Research Center” of the Foundation
German Depression Aid Œ could be set up in Leipzig in the
year under review with the help of the Deutsche Bahn Foundation. The aim of the research center is to engage in comprehensive research into depression independently of the
pharmaceutical industry and to develop new approaches to
therapy. The Deutsche Bahn Foundation also championed
the expansion of regional associations against depression.
This makes us the first major company to campaign for
emotional well-being and the fight against depression.
Together with the Free University of Berlin (FU), the
Deutsche Bahn Foundation is committed to promoting the
moral understanding, social skills and civil courage of children and young people and supports the “Fair player”
training program developed by the FU. The Deutsche Bahn
Foundation supported advanced training in the year under
review for 100 teachers, school social workers and other
interested parties from the schools sector at 50 schools in
Berlin. Educational experts from Hessen were also able to
take part in the four-day training course for the first time.
Setting the course: Deutsche Bahn Foundation
provides people with opportunities for the future

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation highlights perspectives
related, in particular, to education to people through its
projects, allowing them to make the most of their individual
potentials and to achieve their personal targets. This enables
them to take responsibility for themselves and their environment. One element of this is to convey the railway culture
and history in Germany.
The Deutsche Bahn Foundation took over responsibility
for organizing and holding the DB Schenker Awards for the
first time in the year under review. The award is one of the
most important international prizes in the logistics sector.
Awards are given to outstanding scientific work in logistics,
transport and traffic. The prizes include € 10,000 for the
winner and € 5,000 for the corresponding academic chair.
A paper on how the management of disaster-aid measures
can be systematically improved was also given an award in
the year under review.

DB trend landscape
‡

DB Group’s environment is in a state of constant

change. The DB trend landscape outlines the 24 most im­­
portant developments from the four trend clusters of cus­
tomers, society, politics and global economy, towards
which DB Group gears its activities in order to benefit from
opportunities at an early stage and counter risks in a com­
prehensive manner. The DB trend landscape was developed
as a basis for DB Group’s strategy work and has been trans­
ferred into the strategic management process (SMP). Our
aim is to transform potentials into business success at an
early stage. A broad look at the environment focused on a
large number of developments which were analyzed, com­
bined and prioritized in relation to DB Group’s business
activities. DB Group wishes to understand complex develop­
­ments and be actively involved in shaping change. Potential
crucial effects on the future development of DB Group are
presented in the Opportunity and risk report [page 168 ff.] .

Trend clusters
Customers

Our customers’ needs and expectations have changed sig­
nificantly over the last few years, particularly as a result of
digitization. What they want are intermodal interlinked
mobility and logistics services which can be conveniently
managed while on the go and in real time. At the same time,
demand is also growing for environmentally and socially
sustainable products. Fewer and fewer young people in
Europe have their own car, and purchasing power related
to mobility will drop overall as a result of rising costs of
living and of provision for old age. These developments
represent major challenges to us, but they also present us
with opportunities, for instance in terms of further growth
in public transport through new products and services.
Society

Population growth is continuing from a global perspective.
Increasing numbers of people are moving to the cities in
search of work and prosperity. The demand for more effi­
cient low-emissions mobility and logistics solutions will
increase as a result. This also applies to Europe, even though
birth rates are stagnant and the population is ageing here.
It is also making the war among employers for talent more

and more intense. The young generation is showing that it
is motivated, but is also looking for an individual sense of
meaning and demanding time for a private life at the same
time. This is accompanied by increased sensitivity for their
own environment. The readiness to become involved politi­
cally at the local level and to formulate their own social
demands is growing when major projects involve changes
to their personal environment.
Politics

The political environment is characterized by an increas­
­ing acceptance of state regulation and at the same time a
call for increased competition and liberalization. Climate
change is a central issue here. The discussion surrounding
binding targets for CO₂ reduction has not seen results at UN
level up until now. Germany, on the other hand, is holding
onto its role as a pioneer and is continuing in its efforts to
convert to renewable energy. However, the arrangements
and allocation of costs related to the electricity transition
are subject to controversy. Government debt levels are also
continuing to rise in many countries in the European Union
(EU), limiting funds both for investments in infrastructure
and for grants for local transport. At the same time, the
European Commission’s attempts at liberalization are also
aimed at achieving further quality improvements in the
traffic sector. However, actual implementation of new mobil­
­ity concepts with greater linkage and the promotion of lowemission drives has so far been taking place based on local
initiatives in towns and major cities where heavy volumes
of traffic are increasing the pressure to act.

Global economy

The structure of the global economy has been faced with
rising global risks since the 2008/2009 financial crisis.
While the ascent of the emerging nations is continuing,
particularly China, this will not be on a permanent basis,
thereby harboring further risks for the global economy.
Flows of commodities will be regionalized for many prod­
ucts with the ascent of the emerging nations. The share of
intra-Asia transports will increase in particular. This is also
associated with changes in the conditions for value creation
in logistics which are strengthening as a result of technical
innovations and oil resources, which are becoming more

sparse over the long term. The decrease in availability of
crude oil will put increased pressure for innovation on the
mobility and logistics sector. Growing global transport
needs will not be covered over the long term without drive
technology which is not dependent on oil.

National debt

National debt within the Eurozone remains at high levels.
Countries have been forced to consolidate national bud­
gets in order to remain capable of acting. This represents
a major challenge for the traffic sector, which is also tar­
geted to achieve significant savings potentials.

Digital living, smart simplicity, interlinked transport

Demographic change, diverse lifestyles

and young people who do not own a car

and an achievement-oriented society

Smartphones and the mobile Internet are the essential
innovations of the last few years which affect us daily and
have changed virtually every aspect of modern life. This
has also led to new requirements in terms of mobility and
logistics services. Customers today expect integration with
complete solutions with minimum interfaces. Technology
ought to meet complex requirements, although it should
be designed in an uncomplicated and intuitive manner for
the user.
A desire for smart simplicity for products and services is
also coming to the fore. This can, for instance, be seen in the
desire to use a car without owning it. Providers wanting to
survive the competition for smart and simple solutions
have to transfer complex background processes into simple
products and services.
In addition to new drive and control technologies, the
transport sector is also banking on improved linkage of
different modes of transport. Multimodal transport chains
are becoming increasingly important in logistics as a result
of tightening infrastructures and regulatory measures. Carsharing services are increasingly becoming a fixed compo­
nent in the travel chain in terms of passenger transport. In
the urban environment, the trend for young people to own
a car has declined sharply. The solution is being provided
by smart networked and digitally accessible products and
services in local and long-distance transport. The growing
need for better linkage is encouraging the development of
new apps and online platforms which allow mobility chains
across all types of transport.

The world’s population is set to grow by 50% to nine bil­
lion people by 2060. Demographic change features some
significant regional differences. European companies need
to adapt to ageing workforces and implement measures
aimed at maintaining staff. New recruitment methods need
to be found in order to acquire sufficient numbers of em­ploy­
­ees. Being an attractive employer is therefore becoming
more and more important.
People’s lifestyles are becoming increasingly diverse.
Companies need to ask themselves how they can satisfy
these different interests of their employees and customers.
Diversity management is steadily becoming more impor­
tant as a result of this. The work-life balance is becoming
a competitive factor.

∫

Regionalization of trade flows

Products and services are increasingly being produced in
the same business region in which they are in demand. This
is driven primarily by the economic rise of the emerging
nations. On the one hand, prosperity is rising in the emerg­
­ing regions along with domestic demand. On the other, unit
labor costs are also rising in emerging nations, meaning, for
instance, that cost-effective production sites in Eastern
Europe are becoming increasingly important for European
sales markets. This is bolstering development of intra­­regional
trade flows in Europe.

Climate change, energy transition
and sustainable consumption

The high number of greenhouse gas emissions caused by
humans is resulting in changes to climatic conditions. The
consequence of this is an increased number of extreme
weather events of growing intensity. Germany is gradually
switching electricity generation to CO₂-free energy sources
in order to keep climate change at bay. The question of how
the costs of this energy transition should be distributed in
a socially acceptable manner without distortions in compe­
tition remains largely unanswered.
The authorities and public sector in many European
countries are pushing for greater environmental and social
compatibility in the transport sector in order to counter
climate-related and other environmental problems. The
introduction of tolls on roads, entry bans for vehicles and
CO ₂ directives is encouraging demand for sustainable
mobility products and services. New mobility offerings are
increasingly competing directly with public transport. If the
latter wishes to position itself successfully as a sustainable
offering, it must remain competitive in terms of price.
In logistics, sustainability is becoming increasingly im­­
por­­­­tant as a result of increased demand for corporate
responsi­­bility in the supply chain. The focus here is not
only on pro­­duction processes but also on transport and
logistics services.

DB2020 strategy
With the DB2020
strategy, DB Group has created a general
framework that harmonizes the economic ≈ , social † and
environmental ¥ dimensions in order to guarantee sustain­
able business success and social acceptance. To achieve our
vision to become the world’s leading mobility and logistics
company, we have set ambitious targets for all three dimen­
sions: we aim to become a profitable market leader Æ with
a focus on customer and quality ¿ , a top employer † and an
eco -pioneer ¥. To break down the strategic approach with
regard to content and to monitor its implementation DB
Group has developed an integrated target system. Twelve
top targets along four directions ensure a balanced picture
of the sustainable strategy.
The target system applies throughout DB Group and
takes into account the specific challenges to each business
unit. The target system is also intended to enable the im­­
plementation of measures based on concrete targets, to

identify Conflicting targets [page 79 F.] with regard to our
aim to harmonize the economic, social and environmental
dimensions, and to show the progress of implementation of
the DB2020 strategy by monitoring throughout the course
of the year.
In the annual SMP, the business units have translated
the DB2020
strategy for themselves and developed their
own similar visions and strategies. Along with the corre­
sponding targets and the programs derived from them, the
DB2020
strategy is included in the medium-term planning.
Targets from all of our four strategic directions have been
taken into account since 2013 in the end-of-year bonuses for
managers and employees not subject to wage agreements.
We are actively communicating the DB2020 strategy in
order to assure the necessary transparency and inclusion of
all relevant shareholders. The linkage of the themes strategy,
leadership and corporate culture is particularly crucial for
successful implementation.

Digitalization is a comprehensive strategic field of action
which is singled out and which influences us in determining
fundamental changes to our markets, competitors and the
needs of our customers. It represents a huge challenge for
us but also provides the opportunity to address new target
groups, increase our efficiency, improve quality and develop
new products and services at the same time. As a result we
have launched initiatives such as Mobility 4.0 [page 2 4 Ff.],
Logistics 4.0 and Infrastructure 4.0 across DB Group in
order to optimize our efforts to transition our products,
services and processes into the digital age.
∫

Dimensions and management approaches
Profitable market leader
As a profitable market leader Æ , DB Group wants to offer
its customers first-class mobility and logistics solutions. Two
strategic directions are significant if we are to achieve this
target: customer and quality as well as profitable growth.
Strategic direction: customer and quality

We want to provide first-class mobility and logistics ser­
vices, thereby fulfilling a crucial requirement in increasing
customer satisfaction. Significant capital expenditures are
required in our networks, infrastructure and fleets in addi­
tion to the continuous optimization of all service processes.
The following fields of action are being pursued with­
­in the framework of the strategic direction customer and
quality ¿ :
consistent process quality,
expanded customer information and service,
linkage between global IT systems,
renewal and expansion of the infrastructure,
modernization and expansion of stations,
modernization of the vehicle fleet, and
accelerated product and process innovation.

Top targets

>>Increasing

customer satisfaction ¿ : In addition to cap­
ital expenditures in new trains and in modernizing the
existing fleet, continuous optimization of the transport
and other services on offer, comprehensive information
and first-class service are further levers used to increase

customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction surveys
are carried out in each business unit on a regular basis.
DB Group uses the findings from these to derive contin­
uous improvement actions in accordance with the guiding
principle that “customer wishes determine how we act.”
Improvements in product quality ¿ : Punctuality is the
most important indicator of the product quality. Punctu­
­ality is a central component in our performance pledge.
Reducing operational failures is at the center of the
efforts to increase punctuality, particularly through oper­
ational planning measures. A broad-based portfolio of
corresponding improvement projects was initiated for
this purpose. Coping with the continuous growth in vol­
umes of traffic on the rails and, of course, the implemen­
tation of intensive new construction and maintenance
projects during ongoing operations represent particular
challenges.
Driving innovation ¿ : We are constantly investing in
innovative projects and solutions aimed at developing
progressive processes and innovative business models.
Our innovation activities include our focus on develop­
­ing new products and services which meet tomorrow’s
needs. The aim is to establish an innovation-friendly cor­
­­porate culture throughout DB Group. This includes, for
instance, the innovation management pilot in passenger
transport. Further innovations are also planned for on­­
line and mobile distribution channels. We are also banking
on the opportunities provided through digitalization.
WiFi in trains and stations, new apps for even more com­
­fortable travel (for instance tr ain r adar Œ, Qixxit Œ and
the ICE portal), digital solutions for planning schedules
and for tracking shipments and saving resources in
logistics are some of the examples.

Strategic direction: profitable growth

In recent years, we were able to build up our market posi­
tion through organic growth and portfolio additions. Our
intention is to continue on our path of further growth. Part
of this will involve consistently making the most of the
synergies available to us thanks to the integrated Group
structure. Improvement of capacity utilization and produc­
tivity, and the continuous provision of competitive cost
structures are an important prerequisite in order to main­
tain position in our markets and to grow profitably.

Top targets

>>Improving

profitability Æ : Cost-effectiveness as an over­
­riding target in value management [PAGE 101 ff.] ensures
that appropriate long-term returns are achieved over
several economic cycles. We calculate the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) of debt and equity cap­
ital on an annual basis using risk-adjusted market
values. The actual return, i.e. the return on capital em­­
ployed (ROCE), is calculated as the ratio of operating
earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT) to
capital employed. The target ROCE is set higher than
the cost of capital. The long-term aim is to keep the
multi-year average ROCE above the target, thereby cov­
ering the cost of capital. This target ROCE corresponds
to the minimum required rate of return (MRR).
Expanding market position Æ : DB Group has a target of
continuing to expand its leading market positions in all
relevant markets/market segments in future.
Ensuring financial stability Æ : As an asset-intense com­
pany, it is essential that DB Group has constant access
to the capital markets at favorable terms and conditions.
Consequently, an additional material target is achieving
appropriate key debt figures from the standpoint of our
debt investors. A central figure for controlling indebted­
ness is redemption coverage (ratio of operating cash flow
to the adjusted net financial debt).

Top employer
DB Group wants to become a top employer † and to be one

of the ten leading companies on the German labor market
as well as occupying top positions internationally by 2020.
Strategic direction: cultural change/
employee satisfaction

As a top employer † we want to attract and retain qualified
employees who are enthusiastic about working for DB Group
and its customers. We will continue to drive forward the
cultural change that has been initiated and continue to
increase our employee satisfaction.

Top targets

>>Strengthening our

attr activeness as an employer † : We
work intensively on increasing our attractiveness as an
employer – for both our current and future employees.
A visible and persuasive presence in the labor market is
decisive for success in the competition for technical and
management personnel. We therefore continued our
successful employer branding campaign in the year under
review, with the focus on groups subject to shortages.
Yet it takes more to be, and to remain, an attractive em­­
ployer; this is why we provide our employees with mean­
ingful tasks and activities, attractive employment con­
ditions and an appreciative corporate culture.
Increase employee satisfaction † : Contented employees
mean satisfied customers and thus the sustained success
of our business. This is why we have been working on
developing our corporate culture since 2010. It should
be characterized by a collaborative approach and con­
sistent inclusion, appreciative cooperation and manage­
ment that leads by example. The second group-wide
employee survey was carried out in the fall of 2014. It
provides a comprehensive picture of satisfaction levels
along with an opportunity to recognize changes, as com­
­pared with the 2012 employee survey, and to deduce
concrete actions for improvement and change.
Ensuring demogr aphic preparednes s † : ∫ Population
dynamics present DB Group with major challenges.
Competition in the labor market will continue to increase
in future years, and at the same time we need to hire
around 8,000 new employees each year as a result of
fluctuation and retirement. In addition to gaining new
employees, we must also encourage the career develop­
ment and retention of our current employees. The pro­
fessional development of employees should be based
on individual career and life stages in order to allow
them to spend their entire working lives in DB Group.
Versatile development opportunities, meaningful, varied
and forward-looking activities along with a wide range of
opportunities for health promotion, in addition to enabling
the collective pay basis, help ensure employees’ commit­
­ment to DB Group. We are also committed to promoting
the diversity of our workforce.

Eco-pioneer
As an eco -pioneer ¥ , DB Group wants to set benchmarks
with its products for the efficient use of available resources.
We want to expand our leading environmental position by
increasing material and resource efficiency and reducing
CO ₂ and noise.
Strategic direction: Resource conservation/
emissions and noise reduction direction

Eco-friendliness is part of our brand and performance pledge.
DB Environment is responsible for Group-wide environmen­
­tal management. Its central tasks include opportunity and
risk management as well as development and monitoring of
targets and programs together with the business units and
Group divisions. DB Environment and the Group Environment
Committee manage implementation of the targets together
with the representatives from all business units. The Group’s
environmental protection results are evaluated in its indi­
vidual working and technical groups with measures devel­
oped for the central targets within the DB2020
strategy.
Rail traffic in Germany enjoys significant environmental
advantages as compared with other means of transport. We
will continue to build on our leading environmental posi­
tion. A particular focus is placed on the areas of action
which involve reducing specific CO₂ emissions and energy
consumption, along with noise reduction and increasing
resource efficiency.
Reducing air pollutants in our vehicles is a further area
for focus. More than 90% of the DB rail transport fleet is
already propelled using electric traction and thus does not
produce any direct exhaust pollutants. More than a third
of the diesel locomotives also use low-pollutant engines.
Our fleet of cars and trucks meet the highest exhaust stan­
dards and therefore feature low pollutant emissions.
We take environmental protection factors into account
from the planning stage when building new, and expanding
existing, lines. If it is not possible to avoid interfering with
the natural environment then we compensate for this ac­­
cordingly, for example in order to avoid the destruction of
habitats for rare species of animals.

Reduction of CO₂ emissions ¥ : ∫

We want to reduce spe­
cific CO ₂ emissions globally – in other words, those
relating to volume sold – by 20% by 2020 in comparison
to 2006 levels. We have already overachieved on this
target with our green offers in long-distance transport
and efficiency increases in ocean freight of our part­
ners. We will continue to increase the share of renew­
able energy in the traction current mix, increase energy
efficiency in operations and production, and renew our
fleet of vehicles on a continuous basis.
Accelerating noise reduction ¥ : We are working to halve
noise pollution from rail transport in Germany by 2020
compared with 2000 levels. The focus of our activities
will be the continuation of the construction of noise
abate­­ment measures on existing rail lines, equipping
freight wagons with low-noise composite brake shoes
and implementing other innovative track and rail vehicle
solutions.
Improving material and resource efficiency ¥ : We are
making a further contribution to environmental protec­
tion through enhanced material and resource efficiency.
A recycling rate of 95% is a central element in this. We
want to increase clearly our material efficiency by ex­­
tending the service life of our production resources,
using recycled materials and regularly optimizing our
material cycles.
We want to improve air pollution control ¥ and the
protection of nature and species ¥ further. We continued
to work on setting concrete targets for both areas of
action in the year under review.

Interdependencies within
the target system
The interplay of the economic ≈ , social † and ecological ¥
dimensions along with identification and evaluation of the
interdependencies is the starting point for integrated
reporting. These three dimensions are intrinsically linked.
Measures which are aimed at having an effect in one dimen­
sion frequently also impact at least another dimension.
The aim is to reflect and present the intrinsically linked
effects of economic, social, ecological and governance fac­
tors on long-term company success. A holistic view gives
an indication of the added value that a company can create
and how it can secure its sustainable success.

There are also interactions between our top targets: these
are both interdependent within the individual strategic
directions as well as across the different strategic direc­
tions. Conflicting targets need to be identified and evalu­
ated. However, all our top targets have one thing in common:
they have a crucial impact in terms of achieving the targets
of our DB2020
strategy.
Understanding these interdependencies forms the
basis for assessing the effectiveness of measures aimed at
achieving our strategic targets. As a result, correlations
between essential financial and non-financial key indicators
are looked at holistically. The initial perspective is purely
qualitative in nature. We identify the essential interdepen­
dencies between our top targets. We make assumptions on
the intensity of the interdependencies as part of decisionmaking processes, although these are not entirely quanti­
tatively deposited. We started this experience and learning
process in 2012 with the introduction of our sustainable
DB2020
strategy and it remains a challenging task.
There prevail complex relationships between the indi­
vidual top targets. For instance, the expansion of our CO₂free offerings at DB Bahn Long-Distance is having a direct
positive effect on reducing CO₂ emissions and therefore on
our climate-protection targets. Additional revenues and
increased customer satisfaction are further positive effects.
There is target harmony in this regard. On the other hand,
electricity from renewable energy sources is more expensive
than electricity that is produced conventionally (conflicting
targets of profitability).

Adjustments to the target system
We made some adjustments in the year under review either
to or within our target system as part of the regular review
of our target figures and target values.

index B2C for the first time, as evaluation of the baseline
measurements and formulation of the target values were
finalized in the year under review. The merger of the indi­
vidual business unit contributions is based on a multi-stage
weighting procedure, the weighting shares of which differ
in accordance with proximity with the external customer.
Customer satisfaction of business customers has previ­
ously been ascertained based on the results of the surveys
from DB Schenker Rail, DB Netze Track, DB Netze Stations,
DB Netze Energy, DB Netze Projects, DB Systel, DB Com­
munication Technology and DB Vehicle Maintenance. The
results of customer surveys from DB Schenker Logistics,
DB Services, DB Security and DB Fleet Management were
included in the Group customer satisfaction index B2B for
the first time, as evaluation of the baseline measurements
and formulation of the target values were finalized in the
year under review. The merger of the individual business
unit contributions is based on a multi-stage weighting pro­
cedure, the weighting shares of which differ in accordance
with proximity with the external customer.

Profitable growth
From today’s perspective, the markets have developed less
dynamically than we had expected in 2011, in terms of both
market growth as well as the strategic need for inorganic
growth. The outlook for the next few years is also more
reserved. The financial room for acquisitions has also been
reduced on account of weaker than expected profit levels.
As a result we placed the focus on organic growth and
revised our revenue targets for 2020 from € 70 billion (in­­
cluding inorganic growth) to more than € 50 billion (not
including inorganic growth).

Cultural change/employee satisfaction
Definition of the key indicator rate of health is converted
to time lost in determining the basis of calendar days as of
the year under review. This change corresponds with the
current management focus and allows the business units
values to be merged into a domestic Group value. The
target of continuing to maintain stability in terms of rate
of health against the background of demographic change
is retained with this.

Customer and quality
Regular customer surveys are carried out in the individual
business units and service centers in order to ascertain
satisfaction levels. Up until now end-customer satisfaction
(in particular of passengers) has been ascertained based on

families and for young professionals in the target system
for the period from 2015. The monitoring focus hereby also
includes future external as well as internal challenges and
measures for recruitment, staff retention and development
with the aim of counteracting staff shortages.

Resource conservation/emissions
and noise reduction
We have adapted the methodology in the year under review
for the key indicator of reducing specific CO₂ emissions at
carriers. The values from the previous year can therefore
only be compared in part.
The target values for 2020 for the key indicators of
reducing specific CO₂ emissions and the share of renewable
energy in the traction current mix are currently being
revised. The original targets for both key indicators have
already been overachieved in the year under review.

Sustainability management
The theme of sustainability Œ is anchored in DB Group's
organization. The function of Chief Sustainability Officer
(CSO) was created for overall responsibility and is currently
held by Dr. Karl-Friedrich Rausch (Management Board
Member for Transport and Logistics). A sustainability com­
petence center has been set up to support this function. In
this committee, in which all relevant departments are rep­
resented, themes and projects related to sustainability are
managed across all divisions and business units. However,
the individual departments and business units are still
responsible for the content.

Ratings
The ratings agency oekom research Œ has again evaluated
our activities in the environmental and social dimensions.
Once again, we were able to attain a “B” and received
thereby “Prime” status, which designates industry leaders.
In the transport and logistics/rail sector, DB Group achieved
first place. Assessments were made on 29 international
companies, from Japan, Canada and Europe, among others.
The ratings agency CDP Œ (formerly Carbon Disclosure
Project) also assessed DB Group’s climate commitment for
the year under review. CDP awarded its best score A for the

Group’s climate-protection performance along with 99
points out of 100 for reporting transparency. With this
result DB Group has achieved virtually the best score in its
first year of taking part in the CDP rating, and at the same
time as one of only 12 German companies gained a place on
the prestigious Climate Performance Leadership Index in
which CDP lists the 189 leading companies around the world.
DB Group also obtained good scores for its sustain­
ability standards from EcoVadis Œ . The organization com­
piles supplier scores for third parties related to sustain­
ability. EcoVadis gave DB Group’s overall performance its
highest possible gold status.

Memberships
Together with 31 further multinational companies in German
industry DB Group is a partner to the corporate network
econsense Œ . The aim of this is to develop solutions to­­
gether for sustainable business, to initiate political deci­
sion-making processes and thereby to pool and push for­
ward innovations and strategies for issues related to the
future. The network was founded in 2000 at the initiative
of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie e. V. (BDI).
At the international level DB Group is a member of the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Œ .
DB Group has committed itself in this regard to a global
project aimed at promoting sustainable mobility in metro­
politan areas.
We are also committed to the corporate principles of
the United Nations Global Compact. DB Group presents its
progress towards the ten principles on an annual basis
(Communication on Progress). Furthermore, DB Group is
committed to the Deutsche Global Compact Netzwerk (DGCN) Œ ,
the forum for German companies for the implementation
and promotion of the principles of the United Nations
Global Compact (UNGC).
Within the framework of combating corruption, DB Group
has signed up as a corporate member of Tr ansparency International Œ . Regular discussions take place regarding ex­­
periences with anti-corruption systems and procedures
with corresponding standards set as part of our efforts to
combat corruption.

Business and overall conditions

GRI

As an operator of networks in passenger and freight
transport as well as in infrastructure, our economic success
is influenced by the general economic environment and the
specific development of the individual transport markets.
Demand in passenger transport depends, above all, on
the population, the number of employed persons and
real disposable income.
	 The competitive situation relative to automobiles is
influenced significantly by the development of fuel prices.
	 The financial resources of the contracting organizations are also of key importance in the DB Bahn Regional
and DB Arriva business units. In rail and in bus services,
supplying the public with local transport services is
secured through long-term transport contracts that are
concluded between public transport authorities and
transport companies.
We depend largely on economic developments in the
transport and logistics area. Due to our global networks,
we monitor the development not only of global gross
domestic product (GDP) and world trade, but also of
economic growth in the regions, countries and trade
relations in which we have a high market share or in
which high growth rates in the exchange of goods can
be expected. We plan our market activities in line with
this development. The customary early-warning indicators of the business climate and of the expectations of
purchasing managers are an integral part of our monitoring system.
The specific market environment of DB Schenker Rail is
particularly influenced by the manufacturing industry’s
production output and the development of our core
industries. The export and import activities of the individual countries and the transport of goods within
Europe are of particular importance in cross border
transports.
The services of the Infrastructure business units cover
important elements of the value chains of their customers. The same applies to DB Services. In this respect,
the development of demand is a factor that is largely
determined by upstream passenger and freight trans‡

port markets. The area of marketing in DB Netze Stations
is also important. Consumer trends in the general public
are an important factor here, much as they are in general
retail in Germany.
The development of the economic and early-warning indicators, as presented above, influences how we manage our
market activities and resources. Opportunities and risks can
therefore be recognized early on, and, as a result, shortterm controlling activities and long-term positioning can
be focused accordingly. At the same time, we work systematically on optimizing our operating value drivers.

Assessment of the economic climate
by the Management Board
The world economy grew rather more strongly in 2014 than
it did in the previous year. However, the dynamic remained
weak and was crucially impacted by the lengthy recovery
pro­­cess in the Eurozone and weaker growth in the major
emerging nations. World trade performed in a similar manner.
The Eurozone was forced to combat the consequences
of past economic developments such as private and government consumption largely financed by loans. Germany’s
performance was slightly above average. The robust German

GRI
EC9

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t

domestic market continued to be a linchpin of the economy.
Nevertheless, the difficult conditions in important European
sales markets placed a strain on economic development.

Weak GDP growth
The world economy grew by 2.6% in 2014. Higher expectations at the start of the year based on hopes for strong
effects from the recovery following the economic difficulties in previous years were not met. Growth achieved in the
USA was within the scope of previous years. China continued to experience strong growth, although this was
below the level for the previous year. Europe missed its
economic targets, particularly in the Eurozone, mainly on
account of structural problems in several of the large
national economies in the currency union. However, economic strength increased again for the first time after
declining economic development in the previous two years.
In Germany the mood also darkened noticeably over the
course of the year as a result of direction in economic
policy such as retirement at 63 and the minimum wage. The
export sector expanded although it was negatively affected
by the weakness of important sales markets. The crisis in
Ukraine increased uncertainty among investors. Investments which had been postponed in previous years as a
result of the crisis were not implemented in some cases as
a result.
Global trade increased disproportionately in 2014 as
compared with the performance of GDP, although it was
still considerably less than the average over many years.
Structural obstructions such as countries in Europe with
excessive debt and increased relocation of production
facilities to the sales markets are significant reasons for this.
USA

>>Weak start to the year as a result of a severe winter,
decline in GDP in the first quarter.

>>Japan’s economy remained stagnant in 2014 as a result
of an increase in VAT among other reasons.

>>The expansive fiscal and monetary policy practiced
in Japan was unable to provide the desired positive
momentum.
Europe

>>Geopolitical crises such as the crisis in Ukraine and the
conflicts in the Middle East placed a strain on the econ­
­omy and on the general business climate.
Strong increase in economic output in several countries

Positive development also in Great Britain as a result of
increased investments and private consumer spending,
along with an expansive monetary policy which gave
the construction sector a temporary boost.

>>
>>

Eurozone

>>Investments and government spending increased only
slightly in the Eurozone as a whole, together amounting
to just under 40% of overall economic output. This
resulted in a lack of economic momentum.
On the other hand, exports had a supportive effect as
a result of the fall in value of the euro against the US
dollar along with increased competitiveness. Private
consumer spending also contributed to overall economic expansion.
Different levels of economic performance continued
among the individual member states in the Eurozone.
Spain and Greece are benefiting from reforms introduced during the euro crisis.
France and Italy remain weak. Positive momentum from
the introduced structural reforms is arriving in a delayed
fashion. External momentum is only able to partially
compensate for weak domestic demand as a result of
the comparatively low competitiveness.
Germany performed better than the rest of the Eurozone. Performance weakened as the year progressed
following a strong first quarter as a result of the mild
winter.
Domestic demand was once again the linchpin of the
economy. Investments also increased significantly in
addition to private consumption.
Exports also grew more strongly than overall economic
output, despite the weakness of some important sales
markets. However, imports also increased at a similar
level, meaning that the contribution of foreign trade to
GDP growth only increased slightly.

The central hedging policy of DB Group is based on the

all lignite-fired power plants are experiencing a renaissance following historic all-time lows in the coal market
and moderate CO₂ prices.
A lack of controllability of supplies of renewable energy
results in high fluctuations in the electricity spot market
with a decline in the average price level. This also results
in the need for more and more accurate temporal control, which is reflected in significant increases in trading
volumes on the intraday market.
In the first quarter, the price of base-load electricity
reached its highest level for the following year, although
this was not reached again following escalation of the
crisis in Ukraine, despite the concerns surrounding gas
supplies. As at year end the base-load supply contract
reached an all-time and all-year low in 2015.
The retention of 400 million certificates resulted in the
highest level for the year on the primary market at the
start of March (€ 7.6/t CO ₂). The price collapsed to
EUR 3.71/t by the end of March. Speculation on the
point in time for the introduction of the market stability
reserve provided a lift.

The global currency markets turned out to be volatile over
the course of 2014. Economic performance in the Eurozone
along with the announcement from the European Central
Bank (ECB) that it intended to pursue a more expansive

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t

course in monetary policy resulted in the considerable fall
in demand for euros in the second half of the year. For the
entire year the currency traded at a more stable level as
compared with other currencies as a result of the rise in
value during the first half of the year.
In addition to these fundamental influence factors,
there were also some additional country-specific effects
responsible for the occurrence of exchange rate effects:
The Australian dollar (AUD) fell in value, particularly as
a result of the weaker demand for goods and raw materials from its most important trading partner China
(– 6.4%).
The Canadian dollar (CAD) fell in value as a result of the
weak global demand for raw materials along with lower
prices for crude oil (– 6.7%).
Strong economic growth along with an increased inter­
­est rate differential in real terms to the euro formed the
basis for increased demand for the British pound (GBP)
(+ 5.4%).
The expansionary Japanese monetary policy placed further pressure on the yen (JPY) (–7.5%). This was offset
by the increased weakness of the euro.
The Norwegian krone (NOK) weakened for the second
year in a row following the considerable rise in value
during the euro crisis (– 6.6%). Crucial influence factors
included the drop in oil prices and the fall in the base
rate of the Norwegian Central Bank.
The ruble (RUB) lost one-fifth of its value in 2014 amid
heavy fluctuations (–16.9%). The fall in oil prices, withdrawal of investor capital and economic sanctions by
Western countries are placing a strain on the Russian
currency.
Deflationary trends in the Swedish economy caused the
Central Bank to cut its base rate considerably in the
middle of the year. Accompanied by economic growth
which was weaker than expected, the Swedish krona
(SEK) fell in value (– 4.9%).
The Turkish lira (TRY) fell in value (–12.8%). A high trade
deficit and changes in risk awareness among foreign
investors reduced demand for the currency.

The German passenger transport market recorded a performance increase in 2014 and continued its positive development. Good economic and socioeconomic framework
conditions in the form of rising numbers in the population
and of people in gainful employment, growing available
real income and significant falls in fuel prices supported
the development. Comparatively mild weather in the winter
months was also reflected positively in the figures.

>>As in previous years, growth during the year was exaggerated in the statistics by the retrospective incorporation of freight railways, meaning that declining economic
effects are only visible to a certain extent.
Positive economic effects originated from robust foreign
trade and the construction, automobile and consumer

decline.
The market share for rail fell to 17.1%.
DB volume sold remained below previous year (– 0.6%).

The positive performance of the freight transport market
continued in 2014 based on a strong start to the year in an
environment that remains challenging. Growth was supported in particular by road goods transport as a result of
the mild winter and corresponding strong momentum from
the construction trade with its affinity for trucks. During
the year, the pace of growth decreased mainly based on
the economy and due to a basis effect from the more powerful performance in the second half of 2013. While the
robust domestic demand stimulated imports of goods,
exports of goods increased strongly in real terms, despite
the strain of weak performance in some important European markets and increased uncertainty about future economic performance. Unlike rail freight and inland waterway
transport, road freight transport was able to improve its
market position again following the decline over the last
two years.

European rail freight transport

European land transport

Volume sold in the European rail freight transport (EU
28, Switzerland and Norway) remained around the previous
year’s level in 2014 (+ 0.2%). The year was characterized by
strong growth in the first half of the year and falling de­­
mand in the second half as a result of a slowdown in the
economy. This development was backed by the increased
demand in the automobile and construction industries and
on combined traffic.
In a market environment that remains intensely competitive, there continued to be differences in regional devel­
­opments. According to our current knowledge, volumes
increased for the French Fret SNCF, the Bulgarian BDZ and
the Slovakian ZSSK Cargo, for example, but declined for the
Polish PKP Cargo and the Czech CD Cargo. In the European
network of DB Schenker Rail, volume sold remained below
the level of the previous year (–1.1%), which was mostly
because of the declines in the markets most important to
us: Germany, Great Britain, Poland and France. The performance is detailed as follows:

The market situation in European land transport remained
strained in 2014. Performance in the first half of the year
was above the previous year’s level despite some monthly
fluctuations. Demand remained below forecast on account
of the crisis in Ukraine and the poor economic situation in
parts of Europe. The land transport market continued to
be characterized by high competition intensity and noticeable pressure on margins.
The market in 2014 for Europe grew as a whole as measured by revenues (+2.1%). With volumes remaining steady,
DB Schenker Logistics was able to maintain its position as
market leader.

∫

Great Britain

>>Volume sold fell for the first time since 2010 (–2.3%).
Positive performance in construction material and intermodal traffic was unable to offset the steep decline in
coal-related traffic.
DB Schenker Rail UK was able to maintain its leading
market position despite the fall in volume sold.

>>

Poland

>>Slightly negative development of volume sold (–1.6%)
as a result of weak coal-related traffic and the effects
of the crisis in Ukraine.
Market leader PKP Cargo recorded an above-average
performance decline of around 5%.
DB Schenker Rail Polska was also able to maintain its
market position despite a significant decline in volume
sold.

>>
>>

France

>>Volume sold remained stagnant in the rail freight transport market.

>>Fret SNCF recorded a slight rise in volumes and was able
to expand its market share.
Volume sold fell at our subsidiary Euro Cargo Rail. The
market share could not be maintained accordingly.

>>

Air freight

Market development in the international air freight market
improved in 2014: volumes increased by around 4%. The
goods groups Hightech, Machinery Parts, Temperaturecontrolled Goods and Fashion Goods were responsible for
a significant portion of the growth.
Various developments were observed in different trade
routes. While exports from the American continent to Asia
and Europe only saw below-average growth, transports via
the high-volume routes from Asia to Europe, from Asia to
North America and within Asia saw above-average increases.
Market capacity continued to grow through the delivery
of large passenger planes that can also be used for air
freight, although the growth in demand exceeded capacity
developments. Some airlines reduced their fleets of freight
planes or eliminated them completely on account of the
increased capacity in passenger planes.
Decreased levels of overcapacity along with the increase
in surcharges by many airlines resulted in increased air
freight rates. However, the global air freight market remained
at a low rate level as a result of high levels of residual overcapacity.
DB Schenker Logistics recorded a growth in volume of
1.8% in a market situation that remains challenging.
Ocean freight

The positive demand for global ocean freight led to growth
of around 4%. Growth was recorded in the world’s highest
volume routes within Asia (+ 6%). Some other important
trade routes such as Asia – North America (+ 5%) and
Asia – Europe (+ 9%) also recorded growth.
Freight rates remained under pressure as a result of
existing overcapacities and continued deliveries of container ships. The carriers increased the freight rates several
times in the form of general rate increases. However, the

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t

higher price level could not be maintained. DB Schenker
Logistics was able to increase its market share with an
increase in volumes of 4.8%.
Contract logistics

Positive developments continued in the global contract
logistics market in 2014 (+ 5.4%). All important regions contributed to this, even if the Asian markets continue to have
above-average growth rates. Production volumes in the
core industries increased, with demand for dedicated solutions rising slightly in the core industries. Overall, there was
again good capacity utilization and order levels for both
the industry and trading segments. Growth was recorded
in every key country and region, particularly the emerging
countries.
In this environment of intense competition, DB Schenker
Logistics achieved an increase in revenues of 10.3% and
was able to expand its market position.

to more station stops. The proportion of non-DB Group
railways slightly increased once more due to the tenders
won for regional transport services.
The development of retail and gastronomy revenues
and the competitive situation of the range of goods and
services offered in stations are particularly relevant for our
stations. In this regard, both leasing opportunities and the
revenues obtained from these are conditioned by the revenues of commercial tenants. Real retail revenues in Germany (excluding motor vehicles and gas stations) were
slightly higher in 2014 than in the previous year. Revenues
from rental leases in stations developed favorably.

The number of infrastructure customers rose again slightly
at a high level. No other country in the EU has such a high
level of competition in rail transport as Germany.
Train-path demand was slightly positive in 2014, despite
negative effects for rail transport caused by strikes and
storm Ela. The slight rise in volume sold in freight transport
provided the reason for this. The proportion of non-DB Group
railways grew further in line with the long-term trend.
The increase in local rail passenger transport services is
attributable, in particular, to the opening of the Leipzig
City Tunnel at the end of 2013 with the associated commissioning of the S-Bahn (metro) network Mitteldeutschland.
The increase in regular regional transport services also led

Negotiations between the German Federal Government and DB Group on a new Performance and Financing
Agreement (Leistungs- und Finanzierungsvereinbarung;
LuFV) were concluded in the year under review. This governs
the maintenance and financing for the existing German
railway network. As such the success story of the LuFV as
a benchmark for infrastructure financing continues.
LuFV II applies to the period 2015 to 2019. The objective
is to secure maintenance of the substance and positive
development of infrastructure quality. The essential content relates to an increase in funds. In total around € 28
billion is due to be used to fund modernization of the network, stations and power supply facilities. The existing
quality indicators remain in general, although the target
values have been sharpened. A new indicator is being introduced for bridges that have been fully or partially renewed.
An average of € 4 billion per annum is provided in LuFV II
for maintenance of the railway tracks. Of this, around € 0.6
billion is covered by dividends from DB AG, by DB funds, as
well as by the share of expansion projects according to the
requirement plan that are relevant for the existing network.
The rail infrastructure companies have also committed themselves to increase their maintenance expenses considerably, to at least € 1.5 billion each year or € 8.0 billion over
the entire term of the agreement.

Decision to set up terms and conditions of use

Innovation program for the railway sector

The BNetzA imposed an obligation on DB Fahrzeuginstandhaltung GmbH, which is responsible for heavy maintenance,
to set out terms and conditions of use via a decision in
compliance with railway law. DB Vehicle Maintenance has
objected to this and applied for an interim injunc tion
[page 17 7] in preparation for its appeal against the decision.
DB Group believes that heavy maintenance is not subject
to the regulations.

In early July 2014, Shift²R ail Œ was formed as a joint undertaking within the EU subsidy program Horizon 2020. This is
an international research and innovation program in which
the railway industry and railways develop technical inno­­
vations in a public-private partnership which they will then
pilot as prototypes in field trials. The financing amounts to
around € 920 million by 2020 (maximum of € 450 million in
EU subsidies and at least € 470 million provided by the companies involved). The aim is to introduce technological inno­
­vations into the market more quickly and easily, reduce the
overall costs of rail transport, increase capacity and de­­
mand, and improve the reliability and quality of the railways. DB Group is applying to be an associate member of
Shift²Rail.

Further development of the station pricing system

DB Station&Service and the BN etz A agreed in 2012 to

change a price element of the station pricing system. Accord­
­ingly the train length factor was replaced with a volume
sold factor (VLF) that makes a distinction between local
and long-distance transport. The size of the VLF is based on
the current burdens on local and long-distance transport. A
new VLF is due to apply as of January 1, 2015, which is deter­
­mined either on the basis of cost or based on market sustain­
­ability. In view of potential changes resulting from imple­­
men­­tation of Directive 2012/34/EU [page 91], DB Station&Ser­­vice
and BNetz A have agreed to defer implementation of the
new VLF and to extend the period of validity for the current
VLF until December 31, 2015.
Assessment of the train-path pricing system

An overall review of the train-path pricing system by BNetzA
has been ongoing for several years. The completion of the
test procedure by the end of 2014 announced by the author­
­ity did not take place. A decision from the authority is still
outstanding. In the procedure the authority should not
recognize all of the costs submitted by DB Netz as costs of
providing standard services and implement cuts to the cost
and capital basis. BNetzA and DB Netz are also involved in
parallel discussions on the principles for pricing and the
options for developing the pricing system.

Regulatory and transport policy issues in Europe
Contract violation proceedings
of the European Commission

At the end of October 2014, the European Commission
brought proceedings before the European Court of Justice
against the Federal Republic of Germany for alleged noncompliance with the EU regulations on financial transparency in the railway sector. The Federal Government has
already, on several occasions, refuted the Commission’s
accusations in the contract violation proceedings ongoing
since 2012 and provided comprehensive information on
Financial Relationships in Db Group [PAGE 61 ff.] .

Quality Contracts for bus services

In October the new North East Combined Authority, which
is made up of the seven local authorities in the North East
of England, confirmed that bus services will be run in
future based on quality contracts. This is a decision against
the option of a voluntary partnership offering which the
bus companies viewed as a less risky alternative. There will
be two further rounds of voting which DB Arriva will be
part of along with the other bus companies.

Further development of the traffic
and regulatory framework
Higher surcharge under the Renewable
Energy Sources Act
∫ Contrary to the practice to date, traction current, which
also includes the 16.7 Hz energy generated at the traction
current plants, has been fully included in the surcharge in
accordance with the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Er­­
neuer­­bare-Energien-Gesetz; EEG). With the adoption of the
amendment to the EEG in summer 2014, the EEG rate to be
paid by the railways for traction current will also be raised
considerably. The new act includes a change to the “special
equalization scheme” for the railways whereby a surcharge
amounting to 20% of the full EEG surcharge is to be paid
from 2015 onwards. The EEG amendment results in additional annual costs of more than € 50 million for DB Group
alone. These are incurred in addition to the costs of ex­­pan­
­­­sion as well as the increased use of renewable energy.

Implementation of Directive 201 2/34/EU (Recast)
into national law

The coalition agreement of the Federal Government provides for further development of the regulatory framework.
According to the wording of the agreement, “regulation with
a sense of proportion” is planned. Regulation and funding
are to be closely intertwined. The EU regulations in Directive
2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area
should be implemented one-to-one in order to ensure equal
opportunities within the European Single Market. The Directive must be implemented into national law by mid -2015.
However, there is no fundamental need for change resulting
from this. The Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital
Infrastructure (Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale
infrastruktur; BMVI) is working on a draft bill for a new rail­
­way regulations act in order to implement the provisions
under the coalition agreement. No official draft bill [PAGE 17 7]
was available at the editorial deadline.
Ninth Act on changes to the railway regulations

In early September 2014 the BMVI introduced the hearing
of the associations on the 9th act on changes to the rail­­way
regulations (9th ERÄG). The primary objective is reform of
the approval process for railway technology. The draft bill
also includes a change in the regulations on maintenance
facilities. As a result of the planned regulation, maintenance facilities could be released from the regulations on
fees in accordance with a market test carried out by BNetzA.
This proposal remains below the expectations in the sector
and of DB Group. If a market test shows functioning competition, then maintenance facilities should generally be
released from the regulations.
Further development on the fourth railway package

The EU Commission presented its recommendations on the
fourth railway package at the end of January 2013. The
package includes a political part, the recommendations on
the liberalization of national rail passenger transport markets and on further separation of the railway infrastructure,
along with a technical part, consisting of proposals on the
technical interoperability and safety of the European rail
system.
The first reading of this was completed in February 2014
with the vote in the European Parliament. Regarding the
political part, a clear majority was against a far-reaching
separation and voted instead for further improvements in
the transparency of financial relationships in railway companies as well as for tighter regulation. The European Par-

B us i n e ss a n d o v e r a l l c o n d i t i o n s

liament also voted for fundamental liberalization of the
national markets for commercial rail passenger transport as
of December 2019, although with options for restrictions.
The right to choose between a tender and a direct award
should also be provided in future. In terms of the technical
part, an overwhelming majority voted for dismantling the
technical barriers to market access in Europe and for strength­
­ening the European Railways Agency (ERA) in relation to the
national authorities.
According to the ordinary legislative procedure, the
Coun­­cil of the EU must agree to the proposals of the EU Com­
­mission in addition to the European Parliament. An agreement has been reached there up until now on the technical
part only. EU transport ministers agreed in June 2014 that
the ERA should be responsible in future for railway ap­­
provals and for issuing safety certificates for railway companies. The approval procedure should be simplified and
accelerated through clear Europe-wide decision periods.
The ERA should also be responsible for uniform approval
practice. An independent complaints board should also be
set up.
The so-called trialog negotiations started in the second
half of 2014 based on the existing position of the Council
along with the completed first reading in the European
Parliament. The aim is to come to an agreement on the
technical part of the package. Improvements to the technical framework conditions are urgently required, given
that they could contribute to the lowering of barriers to
market access and to increasing the competitive position
of the railways in an intermodal context.
Rail reform finalized in France

The legislative procedure for the rail reform in France was
finalized in early August 2014. The new railway structure,
which provides for reintegration of SNCF and the infrastructure operator Réseau ferré de France (RFF), came into
force effective January 1, 2015. Regulations on conditions
of employment for the entire railway sector and on implementation of the EU regulations under the Recast Directive
are due to be covered in further acts. The harmonization of
working conditions throughout the railway sector by July 1,
2016 should also be implemented via a decree and an
industry-wide collective bargaining agreement. There are
concerns related to harmonization towards the SNCF level,
which would result in a risk to competitiveness in rail freight
transport.

Regular measurement of customer satisfaction is very
important to us. The data is gathered in each case by inde­
pendent market research institutes. DB Arriva relies on a
survey of the independent British passenger association
Passenger Focus. In the year under review around 150,000
passengers and 2,000 business partners were surveyed
across DB Group. The change in method [page 80 f.] within the
survey process was also one of the factors that had a posi­
tive effect on the key figure in the year under review.
Please see the chapter Development of business units
[page 1 22 ff.] for details on the development at business unit
level. DB Schenker Logistics and DB Schenker Rail are ex­­
ceptions here as customer satisfaction is surveyed every two
years for these. At the last survey in 2013 the SI achieved
was 74 and 63 respectively.
∫ Operational performance quality is one important
influencing factor for customer satisfaction, both in the
Business-to-Business as well as the Business-to-Customer
areas. The most important indicator for measuring perfor­
mance quality in passenger transport is punctuality.

The arrival of punctual trains and trains with a delay of up
to a specified time period are summarized in the degree of
punctuality. Within the framework of measuring punctuality
in passenger transport we record the actual times at all
traffic stops and compare these with the scheduled times
published in the timetable. For freight transport punctu­
ality is only measured at the destination stations.
In the year under review, we recorded an increase in
average punctuality values for DB Group’s passenger and
freight transport trains in Germany as compared with the
previous year.
The punctuality of all DB passenger transport trains
improved again in the year under review with an increase
recorded in the average value.

reduce delays to a
minimum during
construction activities

Construction activities on the
rail network also have an
impact on train punctuality.
However, further measures are
urgently required in order to
ensure sustainable quality of the
rail network. Every effort is
made to reduce delays caused by
construction measures to an
unavoidable minimum. Lots of work
takes place during ongoing
operations, whereby only one track
can remain open for the train
traffic. Some works also need to be
carried out around the clock on
account of the major time pressure
involved. Restrictions cannot
therefore be avoided completely.

In addition to customer satis­
faction and punctuality, image is a further important quan­
tity measured in the area of customer and quality. The image
of DB Group is measured using the Corporate Reputation
Index (CRI) and is ascertained by an independent market
research institute. The CRI was at 53 in the year under review.
This leaves it at almost the same level as for the last survey
in 2012 (54), despite the negative effects in the year under
review as a result of the strikes.

Measures in the customer and quality area
We initiated a large number of measures DB Groupwide in the year under review aimed at improving customer
satisfaction and quality.
The Quality Partnership project was launched in response
to the high number of delayed vehicle deliveries and defects
in new vehicles in the regional and long-distance transport
areas. The project is intended as a foundation for new tech­
nical cooperation between DB Group and the rail industry
with the focus on quality assurance. The project is aimed at
harmonizing the high technical requirements from DB Group
and the railway industry at the development stage of new
vehicles in order to achieve the best possible results for the
rail system and its customers.
Further measures in the year under review affecting
customer satisfaction, quality and image are presented in
the Development of business units chapter [page 1 22 ff.], with
an overview of the measures planned for 2015 presented in
the chapter entitled outlook [page 181 f.] .

Punctuality [%]

Positive factors such as more
favorable weather conditions at
the start of 2014, the lack of the
effects of floods from the pre­

improvement measures from
the Customer and quality initiative [page 94] were offset in part
through the negative effects as
a result of severe storms and
strikes by the GDL [page 114 f.] .

Customer and quality initiative continued

Revenues slightly higher

The focus for our customer and quality initiative is on im­­
proving punctuality in passenger and freight transport as an
essential component in our performance pledge, and there­
fore as an important pillar in our efforts to achieve our
targets in the strategic direction of customer and quality ¿ .
Increased construction and maintenance volumes for the
rail infrastructure, accompanied by increased demand for
traffic on the German rail network, represent particular
challenges in terms of us improving our punctuality figures.
The availability of the ICE fleet could be increased for
DB Bahn Long -Distance [page 1 26] , while the rate of devi­
ating car orientation was reduced and the ability to plan
at the start of the train movement was stabilized.
At DB Bahn Regional a concept aimed at improving
punctuality in rail transport across Germany, which had
been developed and tested the year before, was success­
­fully implemented.
∫ DB Schenker Rail successfully continued to develop
and implement concepts aimed at improving stable
operations.
∫ DB Netze Track was able to achieve further optimiza­
tion in the construction planning process and thereby
contribute to the improvements in punctuality for 2014
in passenger and freight transport as compared with
the previous year.
In addition to the activities aimed at improving punctuality,
the customer and quality initiative also played a supporting
role in preparing the measures for winter 2014/2015 as in
previous years. It is also still a central platform for exchange
for DB Group-wide improvement management.

Revenues development was slightly positive in the year
under review and was driven in particular by operational
development in the DB Arriva, DB Netze Energy, DB Netze
Track and DB Schenker Logistics business units.
The special item in the year under review resulted from
the sale of Waggonbau Niesky [page 196] . The special item
in the previous year resulted from the adjustment of
revenue deductions.
The effects of the storm Ela [page 1 5 4], the strikes by the
GDL [page 1 1 4 f.] along with drops in performance as a
result of the growing competitive pressure at DB Bahn
Long-Distance were some of the factors which had a
negative effect.
Our business units in the transport and logistics business
which are sensitive to economic developments only saw
performance which was slightly above the figures for
the previous year as a result of weak economic dynamism
[page 87 ff.] .
The revenue development in the business units [page 1 22 ff.]
varied in the year under review.
Effects from the changes to the scope of consolidation
amounted to € 107 million in the year under review (DB
Arriva: € 97 million, DB Schenker Logistics: € 10 million).
Exchange r ate effects [page 8 4 f.] were attributable to the
DB Schenker Logistics (€ –321 million), DB Arriva (€ 116
million) and DB Schenker Rail (€ 25 million) business

Trends in expenses and income in the year under review
were only slightly influenced by changes in the scope of consolidation [page 195 ff.] . The acquisition of Veolia Eastern
Europe (in the scope of consolidation since May 2013)
along with the sale of Arriva Malta (no longer included in
the scope of consolidation since January 2014) are particu­
larly relevant for comparability purposes. There were no
significant ac­­counting changes for the purposes of the
comparison with the previous year.

There were no significant changes in the revenue structure
at the business unit level.
The revenue development in the individual regions was
mixed during the year under review.
The Germany region recorded an increase in revenues.
This was essentially the result of gains at DB Netze Ener­­gy
and DB Netze Track.
Growth in the DB Arriva business unit which arose from,
among other things, the first full year inclusion of Veolia
Eastern Europe in the scope of consolidation, could be
seen in the Europe region (excluding Germany).
The Asia/Pacific region recorded a slight growth in rev­
enue, primarily as a result of developments in Japan and
China. Exchange rate developments had a negative
effect.
Developments in the North America region were essen­
tially influenced by negative exchange rate effects. Rev­
enue growth was recorded after adjustments for these
effects.
The regional revenue structure remained stable. The reve­
nues generated outside of Germany amounted to about
42% in the year under review (previous year: about 42%).
The share of the revenue generated in Europe (excluding
Germany) also remained stable at around 31%.

Transition to the adjusted statement of income

Special circumstances are eliminated in the adjusted state­
ment of income – the transition to the adjusted statement
of income is a two-step process. The first is standard reclas­
­sifications, with the figures then being adjusted for indi­
vidual special items.
The reclassification essentially relates to two issues. The
first issue is the reclassification of net interest income
components not related to net financial debt and pen­
sion provisions: predominantly the compounding and
discounting effects of non-current provisions (excluding
pension obligations) and non-current liabilities (ex­­
cluding financial debt). The non-operational character
of these components can be seen in the fact that their
influence on net interest income very much depends on
their given interest rates as of the balance sheet date.
		 The second significant reclassification relates to the
depreciation of intangible assets capitalized in the course
of purchase price allocations (PPA) of acquisitions con­
ducted during the assessment of long-term customer
contracts. The existing transport contracts are an essen­
tial component in the purchase price valuation in pas­
senger transport in particular. In order to ensure the
operating assessment and to prevent these contracts
from being treated differently to other contracts, these
depreciation components are eliminated from operating
profit. The sum reclassified in the year under review
relates almost entirely to the acquisition of Arriva.
Adjustments for special items involve issues which are
extraordinary based on the reason and/or the amount
and which would result in an essential negative effect on
operational development over time. Regardless of their
amounts, book profits and losses from transactions with
affiliated companies/financial assets are adjusted. Indi­
vidual items are adjusted if they are extraordinary in
character, can be accounted for and assessed precisely,
and are significant in volume.
The following presentation of income development describes
the changes in the key statement of income items, adjusted
for special items. The effects from the changes in the scope
of consolidation and exchange rate effects are presented
in the following table and are not explained further in the
following section.

Operating profit figures develop positively

Extraordinary result decreased

The revenue development [page 9 4 f.] was slightly positive
during the year under review.
Other operating income declined slightly compared to the
previous year due to such factors as lower income from
the sale of property, plant and equipment at DB Schen­
­ker Logistics and DB Arriva. Lower income from the ab­­
sence of grants in the context of the previous year’s
flooding had an additional negative effect at DB Netze
Track.
The cost of materials in operations remained stable.
Increased expenses for maintenance at DB Netze Track
and for energy purchases at DB Netze Energy were offset
by such factors as a decline in vehicle maintenance at
DB Services.
Personnel expenses were noticeably higher than the
previous year’s figure, reflecting wage increases.
Other operating expenses also increased. One factor was
the increase in DB Arriva’s expenditures for franchise
licenses. Leasing expenses also increased at DB Schen­­ker
Logistics due to capacity expansion in storage facilities
and transshipment terminals.
Overall, costs climbed disproportionately higher in relation
to revenues, which was mirrored in a slight decline in the
development of adjusted EBITDA .
Depreciation rose significantly due to lower reversal
effects at DB Netze Track and new vehicles going into ser­
vice at DB Bahn Regional.
Accordingly, adjusted EBIT and operating profit after
interest also developed significantly weaker in the year
under review.
Net operating interest income improved because of
lower interest rates. This was offset by the higher holdings
of outstanding bonds [page 100 f.].
The development of the adjusted profit figures for the
business units [page 1 22 ff.] was mixed in comparison to the
previous year. The weak development in the business units
DB Bahn Long-Distance and DB Netze Track were only par­
tially offset by a positive development at DB Bahn Regional,
DB Services and DB Arriva.
The development of the other financial result was pri­
marily attributable to higher effects of the compounding
of provisions and liabilities due to low interest rates. The
improvement in the extraordinary result significantly ex­­
ceeded this development so that profit before taxes on in­­
come rose in opposition to the operating profit after interest.

>>We were expecting, based on an assumption that rev­

Net profit for the year

enues would develop positively across all business units,
a noticeable improvement in adjusted EBIT.
In July 2014, we also revised the expectations of ad­just­­ed
EBIT slightly upward because we had expected to be
able to compensate for weaker revenue development.
The adjusted forecast was not met, primarily because
of reasons associated with the strike. In addition, our
transport and logistics activities developed weaker than
expected.
We adjusted the forecasts for the value management key
figures of ROCE and redemption coverage respectively
to the expectations for operating profit figures. The out­
­look for ROCE is in line with the developments of the
year under review. Thanks to the positive development
of net financial debt, the redemption coverage forecast
was exceeded significantly.

Earnings per share (€)

The positive development of the profit before taxes on in­­
come was strengthened by the improvement of the income
tax position. The net profit for the year (profit after taxes
on income) therefore climbed even more. The development
in taxes on income was mainly a result of a positive trend
in deferred tax assets at DB AG.
Accordingly, the net profit (after taxes) for the share­
holders of DB AG developed positively in the year under
review. The net profit attributable to minority interests also
increased.
The earnings per share developed accordingly.

Development in the year under review on the revenue side
was generally weaker than we had expected at the beginning
and middle of the year.
After a slight decrease in 2013, we had expected a sig­
nificantly positive development in revenues during the
year under review.
In July 2014, we revised our revenues forecast to around
€ 40.5 billion. This was the result of expecting negative
currency effects and a situation that remains tense at
DB Bahn Long-Distance.
Even the adjusted forecast was not met due to reasons
such as the GDL strikes. The forecast did not include
possible effects of strikes.

Our EBIT forecasts for the individual business units only
partially cover the developments that occurred during the
year under review.
DB Bahn Long-Distance missed its forecast significantly
because of the tense competition situation and the
effects of the strikes.
DB Arriva developed better overall than expected.
DB Schenker Rail was also affected by the strikes, which
prevented the business unit from attaining expected
improvement in profits.
DB Schenker Logistics had a weaker than expected de­­
vel­­op­­ment due to the economic situation.
DB Netze Stations exceeded their operating profit
forecast.

Financial situation
In addition to aiming for a sustained rise in enterprise value,
DB Groupʼs financial management focuses on maintaining
a capital structure that will ensure excellent credit ratings.
Please see Value management [page 101 ff.] for detailed infor­
mation on the key figures used: redemption coverage,
gearing and net financial debt/EBITDA .
The treasury centre for DB Group is at DB AG. This struc­
ture ensures that all Group companies are able to borrow
and invest funds at optimal terms and conditions. Before
obtaining funds from external sources, we first conduct
intra-Group financing transactions. When borrowing ex­­
ternal funds, DB AG takes out short-term loans in its own
name, whereas non-current capital is generally obtained
through the Group’s financing company, Deutsche Bahn
Finance B.V. (DB Finance), Amsterdam/the Netherlands.

The funds are passed on by DB ML AG to DB ML Group com­
panies within the context of a dual-level treasury concept
as short-term credit lines, which can be utilized as part of
cash pooling on internal current accounts and/or through
fixed short-term credit, or in the form of long-term loans.
DB Group’s infrastructure companies are linked directly
to the treasury centre at DB AG, however. This concept en­­
ables us to pool risks and resources for the entire Group,
as well as to consolidate our expertise, realize synergy
effects and minimize refinancing costs.
DB Group has a long-term debt issuance program in the
amount of € 20 billion in place. We issued a total of nine
bonds and/or private placements over the course of the
year under review through DB Finance. The total volume of
transactions amounted to € 2.0 billion. The terms of these
bonds range from five up to 15 years, and they were issued
in euros, Swedish krona, Swiss francs, Australian dollars
and Singapore dollars. The transactions were placed mainly
in Germany, France, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as
Japan and Singapore. During the year under review, a public
bond of over JPY 50 billion and two private placements of
JPY 5 billion and HKD 250 million, as well as two EUROFIMA
loans, were repaid. The debt issuance program was utilized
to the extent of € 17.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 (as of
December 31, 2013: € 15.7 billion). Utilization of the program
increased in the year under review due to the refinancing
of expiring financial debt and the build-up of a higher cash
position.
With respect to short-term financing, as in the previous
year, € 2 billion was available from a multi-currency, multiissuer commercial paper program as of December 31, 2014.
This had not been utilized as of December 31, 2014 (as of
December 31, 2013: no utilization). As of December 31, 2014,
we also had guaranteed unutilized credit facilities of € 2.0
billion (as of December 31, 2013: € 2.0 billion), with a re­­
maining term of between 0.5 and 1.6 years as well as fur­
ther guaranteed unutilized credit facilities of € 0.1 billion
(as of December 31, 2013: € 0.1 billion).

In addition, credit facilities of € 1.7 billion were available for
the operating business (as of December 31, 2013: € 1.6 bil­
lion). These credit facilities, which are made available to
our subsidiaries around the world, include provisions for
financing working capital as well as sureties for payment.
In the year under review, a leasing contract for vehicles
associated with a new transport contract was concluded
in the amount of € 100 million; its term begins in Decem­
­ber 2017. Furthermore, no major leasing contracts were
concluded.

Outlook

The creditworthiness of DB Group is constantly monitored
and assessed by the rating agencies Standard&Poor’s (S&P)
and Moody’s. Credit ratings provide an independent, up-todate assessment of a company’s creditworthiness. When
calculating ratings for DB AG , the ownership structure
means that the rating agencies take into account not only
the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the company,
but also an assessment of the relationship to our owner,
the Federal Government, and the potential support that
DB AG could receive from the Federal Government. This

are also significant for the ratings given to DB AG.
There were no changes to S&P and Moody’s assess­

Nine bonds issued

We issued nine bonds through DB Finance on the capital
markets in the year under review, with a total value of € 2.0
billion. The bonds served to increase financial flexibility, also
with regard to the repayment of bonds that were coming
due (€ 0.5 billion) and of EUROFIMA loans (€ 0.5 billion).
We used the Australian dollar (AUD) and Singapore
dollar (SGD) markets for the first time in the first half of 2014.
A ten-year bond of over AUD 90 million was placed primarily
among Japanese investors. Funds from the SGD 125 million
bond were used for such purposes as refinancing a real
estate project of DB Schenker Logistics in Singapore.
In the Eurozone, we initially decided to issue a bond in
the segment with longer terms. This bond totaled up to
€ 500 million over 15 years and met investor demand for
bonds with high ratings classes and an attractive coupon.
We also recorded strong demand from French investors, in
addition to the strong interest from Germany and Asia. This
was fostered by the fact that yields on French government
bonds are lower again in the meantime, in comparison to
our bonds. In the second half of the year, we took advantage
of rising demand for variable-income investment opportu­
nities to meet our need to cover our liquidity buffer. We
issued two public bonds and a private placement of € 300
million each with a maturity range that is long for this
sector, from six to eight years. While the private placement
was sold to Asia, both public bond offerings were placed
primarily in Germany and in other European countries.
Interest from Swedish investors gave us the opportunity
to enter the SEK market again after more than ten years.
We issued a seven-year fixed-interest bond for SEK 1,250
million and a variable-interest bond for SEK 350 million.
The traditionally high demand for our bonds in Switzer­
land enabled the issuance of a CHF 300 million bond with
a 10.5-year term.

ROCE

In the context of our value management, we want to main­
tain, increase and guarantee DB Group’s enterprise value
over the long term so that we can finance capital expendi­
tures in our core business. The financial management of
DB Group – and therefore also the monitoring of the suc­
cess of our targets for profitable growth Æ – is performed
on the basis of a value-oriented management system based
on key figures. The results are an important factor for our
strategic approach, capital expenditures decisions, as well
as employee and management remuneration.
Our value management approach is based on profit­
ability and creditworthiness:
Profitability: cost-effectiveness as an overriding target
in value management ensures that investors receive a
reasonable long-term rate of return over several eco­
nomic cycles. We calculate the weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) of debt and equity capital on an
annual basis using market values. The actual return,
ROCE, is calculated as the ratio of operating earnings
before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT) to capital
employed. The target ROCE is set higher than the cost

>>

of capital. The long-term aim is to keep the multi-year
average ROCE above the target, thereby covering the
cost of capital. This target ROCE corresponds to the
minimum required rate of return (MRR). The different
business characteristics result in different target values
for our activities in DB Mobility Logistics sub-group
(especially passenger transport as well as transport and
logistics) and in the infrastructure. The cost of capital
and thus the expected returns from the infrastructure
business units are lower due to our projection of con­
tinually low profit volatility. The operating business is
always controlled before taxes, accordingly the re­port­
­ing of key figures is based mainly on pre-tax figures.
Creditworthiness: as an asset-intense company, it is
essential that we have permanent access to the capital
markets at favorable terms and conditions. Consequently,
an additional material target of value management is
achieving appropriate key debt ratios from the stand­
point of our debt investors. The key figures for control­
ling indebtedness are redemption coverage (ratio of
operating cash flow to the adjusted net financial debt),
gearing (ratio of net financial debt to equity), and the
ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA. The target
values for the key debt ratios are derived from key
rating figures as well as annual benchmarking with com­
parable companies with an excellent credit rating.

The capital employed equates to the assets deemed neces­
sary for business and subject to the cost of capital as
derived from the balance sheet. The increase in capital
employed is attributable mainly to a rise in property, plant
and equipment. The increase in trade liabilities had a damp­
­ening effect.

The cost of capital is updated annually in order to account
for changes in market parameters. We take the long-term
focus of the controlling concept into consideration and
balance out short-term fluctuations.
The pre-tax cost of capital for DB Group fell in the year
under review. This was due to lower cost of capital for
DB ML Group and a higher weighting of DB ML Group, ac­­
companied by slightly higher costs of capital of the infra­
structure. After taxes, the cost of capital rate equated to
5.8% (previous year: 6.3%).

We calculate DB Groupʼs cost of capital as a weighted
average interest rate of equity, net financial debt and pen­
sion obligations. This is determined once a year and reflects
current capital market parameters, the prevailing tax frame­
­work and the value share of financing types used to finance
capital employed.
When determining the company-independent capital
market parameters market risk premium and risk-free
interest rates, short-term debt and equity market return
fluctuations are smoothed out in line with the long-term
focus of our value management concept. The parameters
are determined on the basis of the yields of long-term
bunds as well as the long-term average interest rates of the
German DAX 30 share index. The parameters used are also
validated on the basis of up-to-date recommendations

Impact of capital structure is reflected only in the tax shield; due to DB Group’s
fiscal unity the capital structure of DB Group is used.

Figures as of Dec 31, 2014 (%).

given by well-known valuation experts. The company-inde­
pendent capital market parameters beta and credit spread
measure the risk of our debt and equity financing in com­
parison to alternative investment vehicles. Beta reflects the
risk of equity relative to the risks of the equity markets.
Comparisons are performed against international bench­
mark companies. The selection of peer group companies
and their aggregation to beta follows the business unit
structure of DB Group, DB ML Group and the infrastructure.
The credit spread corresponds to DB Groupʼs current issue
costs relative to bunds with an assumed term of ten years.
At DB ML Group, the credit spread is determined in line
with the market, using current capital market data of com­
panies with comparable creditworthiness.

Tax factors are calculated using a taxation rate of 30.5%.
The tax factor for net financial debt reflects the German
trade tax on the attributable financing costs. Remaining
taxes are fully assigned to the cost of equity. The weighting
of financing types is based on market values. Net financial
debt and pension obligations are valued at their carrying
amounts. Equity weighting is based on recognized methods
of company valuation.
The weighting of financing types for DB ML Group and
the infrastructure corresponds to that of DB Group as the
tax shield resulting from the tax-deductible status of debt
interest arises from DB Group’s fiscal unity.

>>Cash flow from operating activities increased during the
year under review.
Positive working capital effects, as well as a significantly
lower outflow of funds from taxes on income paid (€ +133
million), contributed substantially to this development.
This was offset by higher adjustments of non-operating
items from the sale of property, plant and equipment
(€ –188 million).
The outflow of cash for investing activities decreased in
the year under review. This resulted primarily from in­­
creased proceeds from the sale of real estate and shares
in companies, as well as significantly lower payments
for the acquisition of companies after the acquisition of
Veolia Eastern Europe in the previous year.
Cash flow from financing activities fell significantly
be­c ause of higher cash flows in association with the
repayment of EUROFIMA loans as well as lower net cash
flow from the issue and repayment of bonds [page 100 f.]
(€ –145 million) due to lower issuance activity (€ – 465
million) and repayment (€ +320 million). This was offset
by declining cash flows from the dividend payment for
the 2013 financial year.
As of December 31, 2014, DB Group had significantly
more cash and cash equivalents than at the end of the
previous year.

The value of interest-free loans fell within the financial

Finance lease liabilities declined as of December 31, 2014

Other financial debt was significantly shaped by the de­­
velopment of the bond portfolio. In the year under review,
new bonds [page 100 f.] with a total volume of € 2.0 billion
were issued. This was offset by the repayment of one bond
issue and two private placements with an equivalent value,
adjusted for currency effects, of about € 0.3 billion. Hold­
ings of outstanding bonds increased correspondingly.
In total, financial debt as of December 31, 2014 in­creased.
At the same time, cash and cash equivalents (€ +1,170 mil­
lion) increased disproportionately higher. Net financial debt

were also significantly higher year on year.
The main focus of capital expenditures activities in the
year under review was again on measures designed to im­­
prove performance and efficiency in the field of rail infra­­
structure as well as the continued modernization of our
vehicle fleet for rail and bus service.
At business units level particularly the business units
DB Bahn Regional and DB Bahn Long-Distance posted higher

Broken down by regions, the vast majority of gross capital
expenditures, namely some 95%, was again made in Germany
(previous year: about 93%). Here, year-on-year growth is
primarily due to the DB Bahn Regional (€ +1,019 million),
DB Bahn Long Distance (€ + 67 million), DB Services (€ +14
million), and DB Netze Energy (€ +13 million) business units.
This was offset by a drop in capital expenditures at DB Netze
Track (€ –72 million) and DB Netze Stations (€ – 58 million).
The year-on-year increase in Europe (excluding Germany)
resulted from higher capital expenditures in the DB Arriva
and DB Schenker Rail business units. Lower capital expen­
ditures by the DB Schenker Logistics business unit in this
region had a dampening effect.

2014

On the equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet,
equity as of December 31, 2014 decreased. This was the
results of changes recorded in reserves due to the revalu­
ation of pensions (€ –1,022 million). Low interest rates had
a significant influence here. In addition, changes recorded
in reserves due to volatility in hedges [page 222 f.] (€ –281
million), especially for hedging energy prices as well as the
dividend payment to the Federal Government (€ –200 mil­
lion), had a detrimental effect on equity capital. The posi­
tive net profit for the year (€ + 988 million) and the changes
made in reserves that were associated with volatilities in
currencies (€ +141 million) only partially offset the nega­
tive effects. The equity ratio declined as of December 31,
2014, due to the simultaneously increasing total assets.
Non-current liabilities rose significantly as of Decem­
­ber 31, 2014. This growth was primarily driven by the
increase in pension obligations as well as in non-current
financial debt [page 105 f.] .
Current liabilities as of December 31, 2014, was also sig­
nificantly above the previous year’s end level. This was
affected by such factors as increased trade liabilities,
for example in connection with vehicle purchases.
Within the structure of the equity and liabilities side of the
balance sheet, the share of non-current liabilities in relation
to total assets increased slightly to 51% as of December 31,
2014 (as of December 31, 2013: about 50%). The share held
by current liabilities rose to about 23% as of December 31,
2014 (as of December 31, 2013: about 22%).

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accor­
dance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). There were no material changes to the IFRS regula­
tions or DB Group’s consolidation and accounting principles
that would result in any changes to the consolidated finan­
cial statements.
Total assets rose significantly as of December 31, 2014.
Non-current assets came in above the previous year’s
level as of December 31. A major driver of this develop­
ment was the increase in property, plant and equipment
(€ +1,326 million), above all from vehicle purchasing by
DB Bahn Regional, as well as higher deferred tax assets
(€ +200 million).
Current assets rose as of December 31, 2014, due in par­
ticular to an increase in liquid funds (€ +1,170 million) as
well as an increase in other liabilities and assets (€ +232
million).
This has resulted in a structural shift towards current assets.

Off-balance-sheet financial instruments

Deviations from the projected financial

and non-recognized assets

and asset situation

In addition to the assets shown in the Groupʼs consolidated
balance sheet, DB Group also uses off-balance-sheet finan­
cial instruments and assets that cannot be recognized in
the balance sheet.
The off-balance-sheet financial instruments are primarily
leased or rented goods (operate leases). A present value is
calculated within the value management system for oper­­ate
leases. This amounted to € 4,336 million as of Decem­­ber 31,
2014 (as of December 31, 2013: € 4,646 million). DB Arriva
enters into operate lease contracts, in some cases due to
regulatory requirements, especially in conjunction with pro­
­viding vehicles for rail passenger and road passenger trans­
port. In the year under review, no individual major transac­
tions were carried out that would have had a significant
impact on the financial position. Accordingly, no significant
future effects or changes are to be expected in this respect.
Regarding company pension schemes for employees,
obligations are, in line with the respective rules, to some
extent covered and netted by plan assets which are ca­­
pable of being netted. As of December 31, 2014, total obli­
gations amounted to € 8,607 million (as of December 31,
2013: € 6,671 million), the fair value of plan assets was
€ 3,639 million (as of December 31, 2013: € 3,109 million), and
the net liability recognized in the balance sheet amounted
to € 4,357 million (as of December 31, 2013: € 3,164 million).
The offsetting of obligations against plan assets resulted
in a balance sheet contraction of € 3,639 million (as of De­­
cember 31, 2013: € 3,109 million). In the year under review,
no endowments were carried out that would have had a
significant impact on the financial position. Accordingly, no
significant future effects are to be expected in this respect.

DB Group does not use off-balance-sheet special-pur­

pose entities. These off-balance-sheet financial instruments
are therefore of no significance for DB Group’s asset situa­
tion. Additional off-balance-sheet financial instruments,
like factoring, are likewise not used in DB Group. Accord­
ingly, no significant future effects are to be ex­pected in this
respect.

Net financial debt
as of Dec 31

In terms of capital expenditures, we assumed in March and
July 2014 that both gross and net capital expenditures
would be considerably higher than in the previous year in
the year under review. Among other things, reduced capital
expenditures at DB Netze Track led to gross capital expen­
ditures that were lower than anticipated. Net capital ex­­
pen­­ditures came in very slightly below the forecast from
July 2014.
Regarding the financial situation of DB Group, we ex­­
pected maturities in the amount of € 1.2 billion. The out­
look is in line with the developments of the year under
review. In order to meet our need for financing, we worked
from the assumption that we would make use of the finan­
cial markets with bond issues in the amount of about € 2.0
billion. The outlook is also in line here with the develop­
ment in the year under review.
Regarding DB Groupʼs cash and cash equivalents, we
expected these to amount to € 2.9 billion. Cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2014, were significantly higher
due to such factors as delays in cash outflows, especially
in connection with retained payments and changed pay­
ment targets for vehicle purchases. Effects related to the
reporting date and extraordinary income, especially associ­
ated with the disposal of a real estate in Great Britain as
well as investments, had a supportive effect.
Net financial debt accordingly developed much better
than expected. We expected the net financial debt to in­­
crease to somewhere between € 17.0 billion and € 17.5 bil­
lion. We anticipated that operating cash flow would not
fully suffice to be able to finance the significant increase
in net capital expenditures.

Strategic WORKFORCE Planning
With strategic workforce planning (SWP), we create trans­
parency on future staffing and staffing needs for key
employee groups. We now cover about half of domestic
employees with SWP based on unified DB Group stan­
dards, methods, and jointly developed business scenarios.
Future personnel shortages or surpluses are identified by
function and region. In order to introduce corresponding
countermeasures, op­­tions for action are being investi­
gated and evaluated. In addition, we want to establish
SWP in DB Group worldwide. The first international SWP
models have been implemented at DB Schenker Rail Polska
and DB Arriva Denmark.
In order to optimize personnel planning and manage­
ment in the short and medium term, we implemented a
standardized depiction of staffing needs in a uniform IT
system in Germany. In addition, in the summer of 2014 an
automatic early warning report was introduced that makes
potential risks of personnel bottlenecks in areas critical to
operation transparent.

Derived from individual values for the four DB Group recruiting groups.
Weighted target group values from six ranking surveys conducted
by trendence.

DB Group wants to improve its profile as an attractive

employer and win new employees. To this end, in 2012 we
reorganized the content and administration of our talent
acquisition and we were able to achieve significant improve­
ments in employer rankings. Based on ranking surveys con­
ducted by trendence, Europe’s leading research institute in
the area of employer branding, personnel marketing and
recruiting, our popularity improved particularly among high
school students, from rank 25 to rank 14. Among skilled
workers, we improved our rank from 21st to 11th. In relation
to all target groups, we were able to rise to 13th place. This
puts DB Group quite a bit closer to its target of being among
Germany’s top ten employers by 2020.
Contributing to this was our employer branding cam­
paign “A job like no other,” which was continued in the year
under review. The central element of our employer brand
appearance is our career s Web site Œ . In May 2014 it was
awarded with the trendence Employer Branding Award.

Social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube
are part of our online presence. For example, our ca­­reer guid­
­ance on Facebook was popular among high school students.
We want to retain talented young people at an early
stage with our almost 300 cooperative programs with
schools and 20 national and four international cooperation
programs with universities and recruiting events such as
DB Summer School. Students at universities can already
gain their first work experiences and make important
career contacts in DB Group during their studies through
an internship, as working students or in the context of a
thesis. For university graduates, DB Group offers the pos­
sibility of a graduate trainee program or direct entry as a
regular em­­ployee. Our candidate pools help us to remain
in contact with interesting candidates over the long term.
We want to orient permanently the selection of applica­
tions even more strongly toward their potential and talents.
For this reason, we introduced an online pilot test in 2013
aimed at selecting high school graduates based on their
competencies. In the pilot phase, 35% of the applicants for
vocational training passed the test in their desired career, in
the area of dual studies 28% passed.
Despite increasing challenges on the external job market,
we were able to reach our target of covering 95% of our ex­­
ternal staffing needs in Germany (96.4%) in the year under
review.

PERSONNEL development
We retain qualified and engaged employees through
strategically oriented and attractive personnel develop­
ment. Throughout the process, we focus on developing
specialists and executives from within DB Group. The sys­
tematic promotion of high performers and high potential
employees is an important instrument to ensure the supply
of future leaders and to retain employees. The basis for this
is contin­­uous dialog.
‡ Through written development pathways, career de­­
velopment possibilities are shown to the employees, which
also support succession planning across all business units.
A Web tool and a map of employee development make the
development pathways transparent and accessible for all
the employees. A professional development compass gives
online information about possibilities for in-service training.

With almost 12,000 vocational trainees, dual degree
college students and “Chance plus” participants, DB Group
is one of the largest vocational trainers † in Germany. About
3,400 young people started vocational training with us
during the year under review, and another 280 began a dual
degree program within DB Group. The share of young people
who received an offer of employment at the conclusion of
their vocational training is about 94%. At nine locations
nationwide we offer over 300 spots in our vocational prepa­
ration program, “Chance plus.” School graduates with start­
­ing difficulties can prepare themselves here intensively for
their training, together with operational trainers and youth
workers. Over 80% of participants of the class year 2013/2014
who had successfully completed the program were able
subsequently to either directly begin work or vocational
training in DB Group or in another company. Along with the
teaching of specialized knowledge and practical skills, cen­
tral components of vocational training in DB Group are the
acquisition of service-based, social and methodological
competencies.

Talent management and management diagnostics
GRI
LA12

Targeted recruitment of young talents requires the sys­
tematic identification of and promotion of suitable special­
ists and executives. Today the focus of talent management
is pri­­marily the quality of selection processes in the man­
agement area. Possible instruments for targeted individual
development of talent is a development center for a per­
sonalized status quo analysis and measures which ex­­pand
on this. In addition, we also offer formats in order to iden­
tify talent in DB Group and assist in expanding the breadth
of experience of managers and to promote careers across
various stations (business units, roles, countries).
‡

Understanding of leadership
Since 2012, we have been working on the development of a
common understanding of leadership † throughout DB Group
in which aspects of transformational leadership are empha­
sized more strongly. Its values- and reason-based orienta­

tion plays an important role in selection processes and
decisions about evaluation of managers. Since fall 2014, the
dialog series “strategy and leadership” was continued with
the top 250 managers and executives in upper management
with the target of establishing and deepening leader­­ship
understanding. The format supplemented the activities and
measures that were already begun in 2013 in the various
divisions and business units.

Qualification
Vocational training and professional development of
employees in Germany is conducted through DB Training
as the partner for DB Group education, development and
change processes. More than 2,000 training sessions are
offered that address all target group portfolios and func­
tions. Aside from building up target group portfolios for
engineers and procurement managers, in the year under
review we also developed a modular qualification program
for all employees and managers in the Finance/Controlling
division.
DB Academy is responsible for the qualification of the
about 7,600 executives and future executives of DB Group.
This helps us ensure systematic and continual career sup­
port from one source. In the year under review, we were
able to reach out to about 50% of our executives with our
talent, transition and excellence programs based on indi­
vidual development phases. To continue to keep the offers
future-oriented, a project was launched for its further devel­
­opment. It focuses, for example, on modular program blocks,
international development activities and new formats for
dialog and digital learning.
‡

Corporate culture
The change in corpor ate culture † introduced in 2010 is a
strategy. A strong cor­
central component of the DB2020
porate culture, which is shaped by mutual respect and high
motivation, engagement and satisfaction of our employees,
forms the basis for sustainable corporate success.

Cultural change
In order to move the corporate culture forward in a sustain­
able manner, we have established an ongoing organiza­
tional development process. Taking DB Group strategic
targets into account, as well as the results of the employee
survey † and the findings of regular dialog events, the pro­
cess is successively adjusted and new themes of cultural
change are determined.

The overall results for DB Group show a relatively con­
stant picture compared to 2012. However, there are some
important changes and new critical points. As with the
employee survey in 2012, once again it is possible to see
where employees and executives can takes steps together
to improve even more. Four action areas are pivotal here
for further changes in the next two years.
Communication, information, involvement: As in 2012,
this action area still has the highest priority for our
employees. Many aspects have improved. Employees
are involved to a greater extent; more consideration is
being taken of their concerns. However, the communi­
cation among executives and between executives and
employees is perceived more critically.

>>Leadership: This action area belongs once again to the
most important factors influencing employee satisfac­
tion. The implementation of the new understanding of
leadership remains a central task.
Cooperation: This action area was not a focus of atten­
tion in 2012 and is the only area that received a worse
rating in 2014. And it is clearly growing in influence on
employee satisfaction.
Professional development: In view of the fact that the
importance of professional development has grown, this
topic is also still a focus of attention – not least also
with a view to demographic changes.
Based on the reports, senior executives will discuss these
re­­sults with their employees in over 10,000 moderated
follow-up workshops, rate the changes compared to 2012
and work out new steps to take.

A value-conserving approach to diversity and the use
of its potential are central components of our corporate
culture. Core themes are equal development opportuni­
ties for women and men, and the promotion of coopera­
tive work between people of different age groups and
different cultures.
‡ Together with the Hamburg Institute of Change Man­
agement we ran a study in the year under review about gen­
eration management. In several workshops various views
and expectations of managers in different generations
were worked out and the challenges they pose to manage­
ment were explained. Four action areas were identified:
create a sensitivity for generation diversity, promote inter­
generational cooperation, offer development opportunities
and promote performance independently from age, design
organizational and instrumental prerequisites. The results
of the study are highly relevant for executive and personnel
development as well as for the work we are doing with
corporate culture.
To increase the overall share of women in the company
and in management positions, further steps were devel­
oped during the year under review. A new reporting system
for decision makers in DB Group is intended to create more
transparency about the trend of the share of women in the

Group and improve the opportunities of consistent counter­
­measures. When filling executive positions in upper manage­
­ment, for example, since 2013 at least one qualified woman
must be among the candidates. We plan to expand this
approach to include positions in middle management as well.
‡ The “Career and Kids” mentoring program is success­
fully supporting executives and potential executives with
children on their career paths. In addition, DB Group is par­
ticipating in a network of fathers that goes beyond the bor­
ders of the company. With this, DB Group is prepared for the
“Act for equal participation of women and men in manage­
ment positions in private industry and in public service”
that is expected to go into effect in mid - 2015.
‡ As a founding member, DB Group continued to sup­
port the Diversity Charter Association and participated in
the Second German Diversity Day in June of 2014.

To retain employees in the long term, DB Group plans
to offer them prospects for combining their personal needs

Employment conditions must remain attractive and at the
same time affordable, even in light of changing overall con­
ditions. Collective bargaining agreements make an impor­
tant contribution to these efforts.
‡ Sustainable HR policies are the focus of the collective bargaining agreement designed to address demogr aphic

was negotiated with the German Railway and
Transport Union (Eisenbahn- und Verkehrsgewerkschaft;
EVG) and entered into force 2013. For example, a permanent
job guarantee and a permanent job offer for all vocational
trainees who complete their courses successfully were
agreed upon.
‡ It was also agreed to design working time and
working conditions more individually, in order to achieve a
better balance of work and family as well as personal life.
One instrument is the company working time project.
Employees can also make use of long-term accounts for the
purposes of a sabbatical or for family care periods. We are

placing a greater focus on corpor ate health promotion pro grams † . The topics of aptitude and suitability, ergonomics,
emotional well-being, inclusion and behavioral health pre­
vention are being developed in the “Health and working
conditions” program (ProGEAR).
In the year under review, we agreed with the EVG to ex­­
tend the scope of employment securing along with the
offer in the collective bargaining agreement designed to
address demographic change in order to improve “Special
partial retirement for older employees.” The opt-out clause
for company arrangement of working time was also
extended. This also provides our companies with the option
of diverging from the working time regulations in works
agreements so that they are better able to meet employees’
individual needs.
We entered into a “collective bargaining agreement
concerning special conditions in the event of a loss of suit­
ability for driving” with the German Train Drivers’ Union
(Gewerkschaft Deut­­scher Lokomotivführer; GDL) in April
2014. This governs employment protection for employees
who are unable to exercise locomotive driver activities on
a permanent basis on health grounds. Locomotive drivers
who become unable to drive on a permanent basis can
choose between DB em­­ployment securing the rest of their
career or leaving the company with a special severance
payment. Locomotive drivers who are unable to do their
job on a permanent basis as a result of traumatic events
receive remuneration protection for the rest of their
working lives which amounts to 100% of their previous col­
lectively agreed remuneration (Tabellenentgelt). The pri­
ority of local placing of jobs for locomotive drivers whose
unsuitability to drive is, for ex­­ample, based on traumatiza­
tion or an occupational accident has been expanded.
The basic bargaining agreements with the GDL and the
EVG expired as of June 30, 2014 without any repercussions.
These included the provisions on which trade union is
allowed to conclude collective bargaining agreements for
which occupational group. This was a prerequisite for a
collective bargaining policy with both competing trade
unions which is free from conflict and contradiction. In
addition to wage development therefore, in the 2014 round
of wage negotiations, the focus is also on the basic issue
of which trade union negotiates for which occupational
group. Both trade unions have raised, to some extent, claims
for the same occu­­pational groups. Wage conflicts need to
be avoided where different rules arise on issues such as
working time arrangements for the same occupational
group. De­­spite an unrestricted readiness to negotiate on
the part of DB Group, GDL held warning strikes and a strike
ballot following several further days of strike action.

DB Group has been in negotiations with both trade unions

again since December 2014. Our objectives include stable
relationships, an organized collective bargaining policy and
cooperation between employer and employee representa­
tives with the GDL and the EVG in order to avoid competing
bargaining agreements. The negotiations [page 17 7] are con­
tinuing in 2015.
Employment conditions for executives and employees not
subject to wage agreements are undergoing continuous
development. Remuneration policy and ancillary benefits
will be oriented towards the strategic targets. The system of
targets for our strategy DB2020 is integrated into our vari­
able annual bonus.
To improve work-life balance, since 2012 executives and
employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements
have been able to negotiate a sabbatical of up to six months.
We also support the provision of part-time executive employment and interim management.

Social and fringe benefits
GRI
EC5
LA3

In addition to remuneration that is fair and commensu­
rate with performance, DB Group also offers diverse social
and ancillary benefits. Five major social partners – the
Railway Staff Social Services Foundation Œ (BSW), the health
insurer BAHN -BKK, the association of railway staff sports
clubs (VDES), the insurer DEVK and Sparda banks – offer
benefits packages to our employees.
DB Group provides different care offers to its employees
in cooperation with the BSW as well as childcare provider
ElternService AWO. There are 90 care places available at
DB Group’s own facility “Bahnbini” in Frankfurt am Main and
164 places at private nurseries. During the summer vacation,
the children of employees are able to take part in DB Group’s
“DB RasselBAHNde” program at various DB sites. Parents
also receive support from ElternService AWO in their search
for childcare options, emergency and vacation care offers as
well as with the placing of au pairs and daily care staff. We
also offer wide-ranging support to our employees in caring
for family members via ElternService AWO.
‡

Optimization and internationalization
of HR Management
The cultural change process in the Human Resources (HR)
division started in 2013 in order to intensify cultural change
in the HR organization and to make this into a driver within
DB Group at the same time. The aim is for every employee in
the HR division to become an ambassador for the HR 2020 †
HR strategy. By building an international HR manager net­
work in 2012, we created the basis for trusting cooperation in
the personnel area. Two International HR Manager Meetings
took place in the year under review. The IT system PeopleSoft

115

International (PSI) went live in the production environment
in early October 2014. A crucial milestone was reached with
this on the path towards a uniform HR system landscape for
business units operating internationally. PSI’s HR database
creates the foundation for system support of the internation­
­­al HR processes and international reporting. We had imple­
mented the system in five countries by the end of 2014.
DB Group also further intensified its international recruit­
­ment activities. A Global Talent Acquisition Network was
established for this purpose with representatives from the
talent acquisition organization and experts from various
business units and countries, and which works on projects
such as targeted recruitment in the rest of Europe for va­­
cancies in Germany and implementation of recruitment
standards and measures.
We also ensure transparency related to deployment
options and provide employees with targeted support for
deployments in order to give employees greater incentives
to gain some international experience.
The fourth international Dialog on the Future took place
in Manchester aimed at further developing our company’s
corporate culture. An employee child exchange also took
place for the first time with 32 participants from 13 countries.
A European Works Council (EBR) of DB Group has ex­isted
since 2005 with employee representatives from 21 European
countries to represent the interests of employees beyond
national borders.

On a comparable basis, as of December 31, 2014, the num­
­ber of employees in DB Group rose slightly. This was the
result of the significant increase in the operational and
maintenance employees at DB Netze Track as well as the
expansion of DB Schenker Logistics. On the other hand,
DB Services, in particular, recorded a decrease. The effects
of changes to the scope of consolidation were mainly a result
of the sale of DB Arriva’s business in Malta.

We have set ourselves the target of reducing our

and 2020. We have already exceeded this target with a
reduction of 22.7%. DB Bahn Long-Distance contributed
significantly to this; the carbon footprint has been strongly
improved through the additional purchase of green energy
since April 2013 for green offers. In ocean freight, shipping
companies used larger ships with higher capacity and
implemented slow steaming across the board. In local rail
passenger transport, new vehicles such as the 442 series
use their brakes to feed more power into the grid than did
previous vehicles.

The S -Bahn (metro) Hamburg contributes to the im­­

it relies 100% on green energy and is therefore CO₂-free.
Germany’s Saarland region, however, did not extend its
green energy contract for regional transport at the end of
2013.
The share of renewable energy in the traction current
mix does not include the volume for the CO₂-free products
Environment Plus (long-distance rail passenger transport)
and Eco Plus (rail freight transport); this volume does not
flow into the specific values of DB rail transport because
they are credited to the carbon footprint of the respective
customers. Including this volume, the share of renewable
energy in the traction current mix is 40%.

We want to reduce energy consumption and thereby

CO₂ emissions at our stations. Primary energy consumption

was consistently reduced by 11% at the end of 2014, compared to 2010. Energy-saving measures focused on converting lighting systems to LED technology.
After the opening of the first carbon-neutral station in
Kerpen-Horrem [page 1 58] in the summer of 2014, a second
green station is under construction in Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

The share of renewable energy in the traction current
mix has further increased. This development is due primarily
to the incorporation of the traction current power plant
volumes into the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG)
allocation mechanism. In addition, however, the first-time
full-year effect was felt from the green products offered by
DB Bahn Long-Distance since April 1, 2013.
The target for 2020 is now being revised in light of our
having attained it already.
‡ With 75% of our entire energy consumption coming
from green energy, DB Bahn Long-Distance trains are far
ahead of all other means of transport. On average, custom­
­ers within Germany only produce 11 g CO₂ per person and
kilometer. Customers who do not take advantage of the
CO₂-free products can purchase an Environment Plus ticket
for a € 1 surcharge and also travel CO₂-free.
In addition, all business journeys by DB employees in
long-distance transport within Germany have been made
CO₂-free since October 2009; the same applies to private
travel since April 2013.

‡

Noise reduction
Our target with respect to noise reduction ¥ is also an
ambitious one: by 2020, we want to reduce noise pollution
from rail transport in Germany to half of the 2000 levels.
To reach this target, we are building sound barriers along
the tracks and equipping our freight cars with silent braking
technology. New freight cars have been purchased since
2001 with quiet braking shoes only.

The voluntary “noise remediation of existing rail lines of the
Federal Republic of Germany (Lärmsanierung an bestehen­
­den Schienenwegen des Bundes)” program launched by the
Federal Government has been implemented since 1999. On
the 3,700 km of routes in Germany identified as particularly
affected, sound barriers have been built and apartments
have been equipped for example with noise-reducing windows. A list of priorities indicates where the worst impacts
are and sets out the sequence in which these places will be
noise-remediated. The Federal Government has provisioned
€ 100 million annually for this purpose in recent years.
Funds for noise remediation ¥ increased to € 130 million in
the year under review. Because this increase in funding took
place in the course of the year, the additional funds could
not be fully utilized due to the lead times required for the
planning approval process, construction planning and tenders. A total of about € 104 million was spent for noise
remediation measures during the year under review, resulting
among others in the construction of an additional 55 km of
sound barriers and the installation of noise prevention
measures in 2,400 apartments. A total of about 1,400 km of
routes were noise-remediated by the end of 2014; approximately 2,000 km should be remediated by 2020.
Noise prevention mea sures ¥ are implemented in new
construction and expansion lines in accordance with the
provisions of Germany’s 16th Federal Emission Control
Regulation. These vary depending on the extent of the construction work to be carried out in a given year and are thus
subject to fluctuation.

The use of quieter brakes, so-called composite brake shoes
(V brake shoes), which minimize abrasion on the wheel surface, enables the noise produced in the freight transport
context to be effectively reduced by about 10 dB(A) during
passby – which for the human ear corresponds to a 50%
reduction. There are two different types of V brake shoes
available. We have exclusively purchased new freight cars
equipped with the K type of brake shoe since 2001. The
number of new freight cars with this noise-reducing technology increased to about 8,000 in the year under review.
Since the accreditation of LL brake shoes we have retrofitted more than 5,000 freight cars with LL brake shoes and
about 600 freight cars with K brake shoes in the context of
the “Silent Rhine” (“Leiser Rhein”) project, bringing the total

of refitted freight cars to about 6,500. The refitting of ex­­
isting freight cars is supported by a fund provided by the
BMVI. By the end of 2014, a total of about 14,500 new and
converted DB Schenker Rail freight cars were underway on
the rail network with quieter brake shoes.

The refitting of freight cars is reinforced through the 2013

Completion of special program for noise control
In 2013 and 2014, federal funds amounting to approximately € 23 million and 20 packages of measures were applied
throughout Germany in the con­

in order to minimize selective
noise pollution. Furthermore,
preventive polishing of the rails has measurably reduced
rolling noise throughout the entire network. This method of
producing smooth tracks can reduce noise by up to 3 dB (A).
In conjunction with rail web dampers or barriers, we are able
to reduce rail transport noise by up to 6 dB (A) at some sites.

Infomobile Noise Prevention in action
Since June 2014 the Infomobile Noise Prevention [page 9 ff.]
demonstrates the effects of noise remediation. The project
is directed at residents who are affected by rail noise and
is a joint project of the Association of Freight Car Owners
in Germany (VPI) and the infrastructure initiative, “Keeping
Germany in the Lead” (“Damit Deutschland vorne bleibt”).
Two interactive information terminals present various scenarios of freight and passenger cars passing by, and how
noise protection measures and freight car refittings make
a difference.

G R O U P m a n a g e m e n t r e por t

The online noise pr evention portal Œ also provides
information about strategies and projects for reducing
noise pollution.

Material and resource efficiency
Scarcity of resources and increasing prices also pose a
considerable challenge for DB Group. Diverse resources
are used within DB Group, which increases the pressure
to take action, above all with the use of materials for
products which are necessary for rail infrastructure. We
are living up to our responsibilities in this regard at
every stage of our value chain, from purchasing to operational use to recycling and disposal. We intend to
transform our waste management process from an optimized disposal management system into a modern
resource management system. This is why the essential
aspect of our activities lies in our target of reaching a
recycling r ate ¥ of at least 95% by 2020. This means
that we are contributing from an overall societal standpoint to the increased utilization of secondary raw
materials and conserving our natural resources. Furthermore, the manufacture of recycling materials is more
advantageous in environmental terms than the dismantling of primary raw materials.

Pursuant to the List of Wastes Ordinance, for example waste oil.

We have already met our recycling rate target in the year
under review. This, however, is a special effect caused
by a high volume of construction activity. Construction
waste constitutes the highest share of waste in terms
of volume and has a recycling rate of 96.0% related to
tonnage. We are focusing on keeping this rate high until
2020, and to also achieve an increase in the other areas.
We do not consider thermal utilization, meaning waste
incineration, to be a form of recycling; it is therefore not
included in the rate. We have also developed measures
for increasing the utilization of recycling materials and
extending the useful life of resources, for example our
vehicles.

Redesigning as a means of prolonging useful life
We prolong the useful life of our fleets [page 2 78]

and energy consumption. If a vehicle is nevertheless
slated for decommissioning, it is either sold or its reusable components are removed and sent for recycling.

Air quality control
Reducing pollutant emissions
We are constantly working towards reducing the
emissions produced by our vehicle fleet. The use of
modern vehicles continuously reduces nitrogen oxide
and particulate emissions caused by rail transport. Be­­
tween 1990 and 2014, we reduced nitrogen oxide emissions by 78% and particulate emissions by 89% in rail
transport in Germany. The high electrification rate of
our rail network played a major role here because the
vehicles themselves do not produce pollutant emissions; only the generation of traction current causes
emissions, and this is minimized by modern filtering
technology. We are working with an increasing share of
renewable energy in the traction current mix to reduce
pollution from energy production. In addition, our rail
and road vehicles meet high European standards and
thereby ensure low pollution emissions.

Responsibility for the plant and animal world
Railway lines, as well as other facilities and properties held by DB Group, often provide a unique habitat
for protected species. This fact forms the basis for our
acknowledgment of our responsibility to maintain biological diversity. We seek solutions that make both ecological and economic sense wherever conflicts arise. We
are currently working with environmental organizations
to develop regulations for overhead catenary lines that
are bird-friendly. ‡ In order to be able to promptly
identify points of contact between the natural world
and train-paths, we use a geographical information
system (GIS) which stores details of rail lines and all
digitally registered conservation areas within Germany.
We can only conduct our operations in a manner which
takes account of the sensitivity of these areas, armed
with knowledge of any points of contact between our
train-paths and properties with conservation areas.

Extension of existing contract.

In Great Britain, DB Arriva was successful with one additional tender for patient transport services with a total
volume of 0.3 million km per year. The new term started
in October 2014 (term: one year).

In the digital age, the availability of Internet access
plays an important role for passengers. Several individ­
­ual projects aim to improve this.
Expanding reception, especially in rural areas, a total
of 5,200 km of the ICE network equipped with broadband Internet technology.
Equipping all ICEs with wireless Internet hotspots.
WiFi availability in over 120 train stations in metropolises and medium-size cities.
We have developed a mobility platform with Qix xit Œ
that offers comprehensive, door-to-door travel planning
with all means of transport in Germany.
The launch of the video travel center kicked off an
innovative sales format. Despite the trend towards automated sales, customers still have the option of receiving
support from a real person.
We have also expanded our mobile payment options.

The premiere key performance indicator here is volume
sold. The relative capacity utilization of the vehicles is also
measured on the basis of the key figures of passengers per
train and the load factor. The cost side correlates almost
entirely with the volume produced. This also depends on
the train schedule. Personnel and facility resource management is determined on the basis of the annual train schedule
to optimize the cost per unit per train kilometer traveled.
The cost structure is very fixed-cost-intensive because of
the maintenance of an extensive production system. Major
drivers are personnel, maintenance and infrastructure ex­­
penses. Only a small portion of costs varies with train capacity
utilization.
The most important source of income for commercially
operated long-distance transport are revenues from the
sales of tickets and BahnCards as well as seat reservations
and on-board restaurant services.
Our employees, a modern vehicle fleet and a high-quality
infrastructure are key resources. This is why DB Group’s
in­ternal infrastructure companies, service providers and the
vehicle industry are important partners for DB Bahn LongDistance. Furthermore, cooperation with railway companies in countries bordering Germany is very important for

cross-border connections. We are currently revising the
business model for DB Bahn Long-Distance due to current
developments in the long-distance transport market.
Markets and strategy

The Long-Distance 2020 strategy pursues the target of
being the first choice for customers and employees in 2020.
Economic ≈ dimension: DB Bahn Long-Distance is pursuing the target of offering its customers high-quality
products and thereby achieving profitable growth. We
endeavor to provide the most relaxed form of travel.
For example, all trains in the ICE fleet will be equipped
with wireless Internet hotspots. The use of our products
and services should become even easier. The BahnCard,
as the leading mobility card, will offer simplified access
to a diverse range of modes of transport. The inclusion of
further mobility services is being planned. We are gearing
up with these measures to combat growing competition
from the long-distance bus market. By 2020, we want to
offer the most recognized and trusted product, both in
terms of travel times and service. Our employees provide active support for our passengers in case of service
interruptions and take care to provide both optimal

important contribution to improving the reliability of
our performance pledge.
Social † dimension: In order to keep our promises to our
customers, we expect our employees to have a strong
focus on customers and quality. One prerequisite for
this is a solid cooperative spirit that can bring employees
together and allow them to participate. This is why we
are constantly working on improving our employee satisfaction, for example by including our employees in the
planning of specific working conditions, which also in­­­
creases our appeal as an employer.
Environmental ¥ dimension: DB Bahn Long-Distance has
the target of being the most environmentally friendly
provider of services to its customers by 2020. Green longdistance transport is a central element in this regard.
Currently, about 75% of traction current is drawn from
renewable energy sources.

Events in 2014

Vehicle availability in long-distance transport

The availability of the ICE fleet has improved during the
year under review:
Mild weather conditions at the beginning of the year
led to limited vehicle impairments so that the reliability
of the fleet could be stabilized thanks to available maintenance capacities.
In the summer, lower winter reserves, a higher number
of vehicle defects and weaker punctuality led to tense
operating conditions.
The measures for improvement introduced last year,
such as optimization of circulation, had positive effects.
The trial run of the first eight 407 series ICE 3 trains also
had a favorable effect. At the same time, the accreditation of these trains abroad continues to move forward
with measured test runs. We anticipate that the trains
will gain accreditation for the French network in 2015.
Expected improvements in the availability of the existing
ICE 3 and ICE T fleets have so far failed to materialize due to
delays in the planned replacement of wheel sets. Approval
of the ICE 3 trains featuring the newly developed drive
wheel sets was only issued in mid-October. The conclusion
of the train refitting will likely extend into 2018. Furthermore, there is an increased need to replace the drive wheel
sets of ICE 1 and ICE 2 trains.
The in-service date for the new double-deck Intercitys
has also been further delayed and will not take place before
the end of 2015.

>>

Vehicle projects in long-distance transport

The retrofitting of the ICE T fleet continued, with 13 of 42
multiple units completed. The core of the work is focusing
on the stabilization and modernization of vehicle technol­
­ogy. Improvements are being done in the interiors, and
individual components are being rebuilt.
At the same time, preparations continued for the redesign of the ICE 3, which will begin in 2016. We have initiated
technology and comfort measures, and technical development has begun. The multiple units of the ICE T and ICE 3
fleet are also being equipped to run the European Train
Control System (ETCS).
We completed the full modernization of all 773 cars in
our IC and EC fleet in 2014. Stabilization with additional
technological means will be finished by the end of 2015.
Liberalization of the long-distance bus market in Germany

The German long-distance bus market has developed very
dynamically since its liberalization in 2013. Several new providers have set up large networks in Germany. The struggle
for market share was waged primarily with tough price
competition. The first consolidations within the market have
occurred. In the coming two to three years, market growth
will continue, although with a slowing dynamic.
The establishment of additional offerings in the German
long-distance transport market is leading to a shift in
de­mand at the expense of long-distance rail passenger
transport.
Expanding IC bus connections

Three cross-border IC bus connections started operations
in the year under review (Munich – Slovenia – Croatia, Düsseldorf – the Netherlands, Düsseldorf – Belgium). Transport
services are integrated in the sales system and the schedule.
Services for mobile devices expanded

>>The train radar, introduced last year in an online version,
has been available as an app since April. It provides
information about train runs and punctuality.
Since early 2014, customers who buy a smartphone ticket
with a BahnCard discount and a travel distance of over
100 km receive a free city ticket, which allows them to
use regional transport in more than 120 cities to get to
the station and from the station at their destination.
Online tickets, which can be booked as smartphone
tickets, can be loaded into the mobile DB navigator app
as of the year under review. This removes the need to
print out the ticket.

Overall, the decline in revenues, accompanied by a parallel
rise in expenses, led to noticeable deterioration in adjusted
EBITDA and adjust EBIT.
Gross capital expenditures in the year under review
climbed primarily because of payments made for ICE 3

The number of employees as of December 31, 2014, fell
slightly due in part to adjustments in the scope of services
in car and night train transport. In contrast, personnel was

The health rate remained in the year under review approx­
­imately the same as the previous year.
There is a lot of competition for talent in the metropolitan regions of Southern Germany in particular, which is why
the coverage rate for external staffing needs decreased
during the year under review.
In comparison to 2006, energy consumption was reduced
by more than one-fifth. During the year under review, the
energy-efficient driving methods of our train drivers made
the greatest contribution to reducing our energy consumption, along with the integration of energy-efficient power
converters. Competition for train drivers, local energy consumption measures and regular communication led to
marked energy savings in comparison to the previous year.

DB Bahn Regional business unit
Business model

DB Bahn Regional’s core service is to bring millions of pas-

sengers in regional transport each day to their desired destination in a punctual, safe, reliable and environmentally
friendly way. In doing so, we fulfill the requirements of the
transport authorities in a reliable fashion.
An extensive network of RegionalExpress, regional train,
S -Bahn (metro) and regional bus lines offers passengers
connections in metropolitan areas and the surrounding countryside. Regional transport operators combine service planning and provisioning with the target of offering local transport that meets local transport needs.
As a negotiating partner for transport authorities at the
state and municipal level, DB Bahn Regional participates in
competitions for long-term transport contracts and route
concessions. We are defending our leading market position
with integrated transport concepts and high capital expenditures on our vehicles.
Volume sold and volume produced are important key
per­­formance figures. Transport contracts typically reference volume produced. Moreover, there are contracts with
public transport authorities in which fare box revenues are
awarded directly to the contracting organization, while the
transport company is completely compensated for the
entire range of its services by the public transport authority
(gross contracts). Due to the fact that transport contracts
span several years, functioning sliding price mechanisms
that allow unexpected cost developments to be passed on
to the public transport authorities play an important role in
managing the procurement market risks relating to energy,
personnel and infrastructure utilization. Another important
risk management component is how reutilization risk is
managed in the event that the useful life of vehicles exceeds
the term of a transport contract. An operationally flexible
vehicle fleet coupled with a broad and balanced portfolio
of transport contracts considerably reduces this risk.
Concession fees, next to revenues from ticket sales, are
the most important source of income.
Our employees, a modern vehicle fleet and a highquality infrastructure are key resources for offering punctual transport. This is why DB Group’s internal infrastructure companies, service providers and the vehicle industry
are im­­portant partners for DB Bahn Regional. Furthermore,
cooperation with public transport authorities is very important.

Predefined terms in transport contracts and route concessions, combined with the extensive production system in
place, result in a cost structure with high fixed costs. Major
drivers are personnel, maintenance, energy and infrastructure expenses. Only a small portion of costs varies with train
capacity utilization.

measures that have been identified and initiated since
2013 is to continually strengthen our competitiveness at
all company levels (regions, transport operations, central areas). Our bus service had to prove itself in a field
that has become increasingly competitive in recent years.
Increasing cost pressure in competitive invitations to
tender was balanced with a comprehensive efficiency
program by the regional bus line of business. Over the
long term, the market share in the public road passenger
transport market shall be maintained and profitable
growth opportunities through innovative products and
creative market penetration shall be used.
Social † dimension: Satisfied employees are essential
for a successful business in the public local transport
market and for our attractiveness as an employer. In order
to involve employees in the continual improvement of
our company, we have entered into an intense dialog
with our executives, and we want to include employees
in this conversation in the future as well. The implementation of the collective bargaining agreement designed

Markets and strategy

The German local transport market will again be one of the
most interesting markets in Europe in the coming years,
even if contract volumes recede in the medium term.
Economic ≈ dimension: We want to increase our customer
satisfaction and defend our market position in a profitable way.
	 Our service pledge to customers is central to the way
we operate. In addition to our comprehensive efforts to
improve effectiveness and efficiency, we are also focus­
­ing on our customers. The significant increase in the hit
rate in rail business in the last two years confirms that
we should continue following this path. The target of the

Events in 2014

Vehicle renovation continued

We are also working on constantly improving our local
transport vehicle fleet. Upon a commission by the S-Bahn
(metro) Rhine-Main, 51 vehicles in the 423 series had
already been renovated by the end of 2014. This number
will reach 100 vehicles by the

struggled with delays across
the board in the delivery of vehicles.
For example, out of 16 new ICE 3
sets, only eight have gone into service. The delivery of our new
double-decker cars for long-distance and regional transport are
similarly delayed. We are
striving to ameliorate these restrictions as much as possible for our
customers. Numerous replacement
transports were set up, IC trains
replaced ICE trains, and singledecker cars substituted for doubledecker cars. Due to these delivery
bottlenecks, however, we are still
lacking reserve vehicles for

defects in the vehicles delivered, and the remedying of
these defects is ongoing. In mid - 2014, both parties asserted
the significant parts of their reciprocal claims arising from
the series 442 project as a precaution by introducing procedural measures.
Bombardier’s delivery of 87 series 430 vehicles for the
S -Bahn (metro) Stuttgart began late in 2013 and finished
in late 2014. Substitution transport services with old vehicles
was required due to continued delivery delays. The vehicles
can still be used for passenger transport only without the
retractable step function. Bombardier also asserted significant parts of its asserted claims as a precaution by introducing procedural measures.
The series accreditation for the 91 series 430 vehicles
ordered for the Rhine-Main project was only issued in midMarch 2014. There were also additional delays in the de­­
livery of the vehicles. By the end of 2014, DB Bahn Regional
accepted 89 vehicles.
The 56 series 620/622 diesel multiple units ordered from
Alstom for the Cologne diesel network were and are being
delivered late because of quality problems and delays in
accreditation. In the meantime, 52 vehicles have been
accepted. The last vehicles are scheduled for delivery in
early 2015. The Cologne diesel network was served with
substitution vehicles until the end of 2014.

There were no significant changes in 2014 regarding the
ongoing formal investigation by the EU Commission against
the Federal Government for the alleged provisioning of
illegal subsidies as a result of the conclusion of a transport
contract between DB Bahn Regional and the states of Berlin
and Brandenburg. This also applies to the preliminary
investigations concerning the transport contract for S-Bahn
(metro) Berlin, the transport contract of the Rhine-Ruhr
transport association (Verkehrsbund Rhein-Ruhr; VRR), as
well as the outside rail lines and the Baden Wurttemberg
transport contract.

In 2007, DB Bahn Regional and
Bombardier signed a framework agreement for the development, manufacture and deliv­
­ery of up to 321 electric multiple
units (EMU) from the 442 series
(Talent 2) on a platform basis.
The 13th order in March completely exhausted the framework contract. In order to push
forward with the delivery of
vehicles despite existing problems, we have agreed on a procedure with Bombardier where­­by
we will continue to take deliveries of orders one through

remained at the previous year’s
level, while volume sold in bus
service decreased somewhat. Over­­all, we recorded a slight
drop.
Revenues also came in at the level of the previous year.
In the rail line of business, revenues posted a slight decrease
that can be attributed primarily to the strikes. The increase
in revenues in the bus line of business had a dampening
effect. New services as well as legal changes related to
compensation payments also had positive effects.
In contrast, other operating income posted growth due
to higher indemnity payments and releases of provisions.

number of employees had the
opposite effect on personnel expenses.
Overall, the profit situation developed positively, driven
by developments in the rail line of business. The adjusted
profit figures for EBITDA and EBIT increased noticeably.
Gross capital expenditures increased significantly due
to higher capital expenditures in the vehicle fleet, particularly in the rail line of business. The acquisition of S-Bahn
(metro) series 430 electric multiple units for the S -Bahn
(metro) Stuttgart and the S-Bahn (metro) Rhine-Main had
a major effect. In the bus line of business, new buses were
also purchased in the context of new services obtained.
The number of employees remained stable relative to
figures for December 31, 2013. Performance-related decreases
in the rail line of business were partly offset by performance-related growth in the bus division.
Employee satisfaction remained stable. Positive effects
from measures implemented in the last two years were offset
by negative effects due to the loss of transport contracts.
The share of women increased due to our focus on hiring
women.
Positive developments in health rate were offset for
strike-related reasons, so that this remained stable.
External staffing needs were covered better than in the
previous year. Projects were developed for various target
groups to increase value creation in the recruiting process.
End-energy consumption was further reduced in rail
transport by the utilization of modern vehicles and energyefficient driving methods. In our bus service, we were not
able to attain any major energy savings compared to 2006
due to technical quality improvements; the trend since 2012
has, however, remained positive.

Both volume sold and volume produced in the rail line of
business developed at the level of the previous year. Growth
in the northeastern region, the S-Bahn (metro) Berlin, and
the start of operations in the S-Bahn (metro) network Mittel­
­deutschland were offset by a decline of performance, especially in Bavaria, and by effects from strikes. The number of
passengers rose slightly.
Overall revenue development also remained at the level
of the previous year. Losses due to the GDL strikes were
almost fully offset by, among other things, higher internal
revenues from transport associations related to pricing and
the elimination of the previous year’s negative effects from
the flood. Correspondingly, external revenues developed
below the level of the previous year.
Other operating income increased significantly as a result
of higher compensation payments connected to vehicle
procurement. This was partly offset by a fall in earnings from
replacement transport services, among other things.
Cost of materials (– 0.7%) fell due to reduced expenses for
energy and sales provisions. By contrast, there was a pricerelated increase in the costs for infrastructure utilization.
Personnel expenses (+1.2%) increased slightly due to
collective wage agreements.
Other operating expenses decreased. This was primarily
due to lower additions to provisions.
The arrival of new vehicles significantly increased
depreciation.
Overall, expenses dropped more than revenues, which
means that the operating profit figures improved. Adjusted
EBITDA and adjusted EBIT increased.

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t D e v e l o p m e n t o f busi n e ss u n i t s

Gross capital expenditures were significantly higher yearon-year. This resulted in particular from the arrival of series
430 electric multiple units for the S-Bahn (metro) Stuttgart
and the S-Bahn (metro) Rhine-Main, as well as the 620/622
series diesel multiple units for the Cologne diesel network.
The number of employees decreased slightly in comparison to December 31, 2013 due to performance losses.

The disproportionate increase in income led to an improvement in the adjusted profit figures.
Gross capital expenditures increased primarily because
of vehicle procurements for newly won transport services.
The number of employees increased in comparison to
December 31, 2013, because of won transport services in
the Rhine-Neckar region and Hesse.

The year under review saw a decline in performance in bus
service. Volume sold decreased, primarily because of a
decline in the number of passengers, especially high school
students. Performance losses as well as reductions in performance in the context of business portfolio optimizations
were only partially balanced out by newly won transport
services, which meant that volume produced declined.
Total and external revenues increased. In addition to new
services, higher revenues from compensation payments
connected to passenger services for trainees, caused by a
legislative change, contributed to this increase. Lower revenues from rail replacement services had the opposite
effect. Other operating income climbed due to releases of
provisions as well as effects of the sale of property, plant
and equipment.
Cost of materials (– 0.9%) fell slightly due to sinking
diesel prices as well as a reduced utilization of external
services.
Personnel increases in particular caused an increase in
personnel expenses (+3.1%). Other operating expenses in­­
creased due to, among other things, higher consultation
services costs. Depreciation decreased due to vehicle sales.
Vehicle purchases had a dampening effect.

Business model

DB Arriva is DB Group’s European growth platform in pas-

senger transport. With buses, trains, trams, water buses
and patient transports, we offer a broad range of transport
services in 14 European countries. The activities of DB Arriva
are divided into three lines of business: UK Bus, UK Trains
and Mainland Europe.
Customers are primarily regional and national authorities
or other contracting organizations. Proximity to local markets, as well as the capability of adjusting to complex legislative environments and fulfilling growing customer requirements are of major importance for reaching our targets.
We are working together with our most important partners – our customers – to design efficient and sustainable
transport.
Revenues are generated above all by ordered service
transports, along with our own transport services. Contracting organizations especially appreciate our strengths
in terms of efficiency, reliability, price-performance ratios
and customer service.
Contracts for ordered transport services can be designed
in different ways. These range from gross contracts with
fixed revenues, to contracts with revenue risk or bonus/
penalty rules related to quality or passenger numbers. For
the transport services that we operate on our own, however, ticket sales are the primary source of income.
Vehicles are sometimes provisioned by the contracting
organization for ordered transport services. Cost drivers
are therefore primarily personnel and energy expenses.
Markets and strategy

In addition we are introducing new ticketing systems
through mobile and online solutions. Our measures in rail
passenger transport in Great Britain received industry awards
for using innovative advance booking and ticketing solutions, thereby setting standards for quality and customer
satisfaction.
Profitable growth is our basis for guaranteeing a stable
and sustainably successful business. Our participation in
tenders for transport contracts, as well as conducting acquisitions, is based on our conviction that we can increase the
value of the companies we take over.
In the UK Bus line of business, we aim to optimize existing
business and expand the services offered to customers. For
example, our premium bus service, Sapphire, posted strong
growth and will be expanded further.
In the UK Trains line of business, we want to strengthen
and expand our existing transport contracts, win additional
contracts, and grow through open-access transport services.

In the Mainland Europe line of business, we are growing with
newly won transport contracts, focused M&A activities,
and the expansion of our existing business. The liberalization of the European transport markets is also creating
opportunities.
Social † dimension: Satisfied employees are an essential
component of our success. Our attractiveness as an em­­
ployer enables us to recruit and retain talented executives and outstanding skilled employees. Furthermore,
we have initiated health programs to increase employee
well-being.
Environmental ¥ dimension: In order to reduce the overall
influence of the transport sector on the environment, we
are campaigning for passenger transport and an active
shift from cars to bus and rail. Well on our way to be­­
coming an eco-pioneer, we want to leverage our comprehensive experience in fuel and environmental technologies and work together with manufacturers to reduce
the effects of passenger transport on the environment.
	 Going beyond initiatives for environmentally friendly
methods of driving, in which we equipped more than
9,000 of our buses with driver assistance systems, we
will expand the use of the automatic fuel-saving Econo Speed Œ system in the future. DB Arriva also maintains
various partnerships with leading bus manufacturers to
promote further the use of alternative energy sources
and to continually improve our carbon footprint.
	 We have also implemented measures to reduce water
consumption and waste. In this context, we equipped
most of our sites with rainwater collection systems, solar
modules and their own wind turbines.

Events in 2014

Expanding the European network

>>Alliance Rail Holdings announced various new projects,
operated on a purely commercial basis, for DB Arriva UK
Trains. These projects include a direct express line on
the East Coast main line between London King’s Cross
and West Yorkshire/Lincolnshire, as well as a Pendolino
HGV line between London and Edinburgh.
The Office of Rail Regulation has awarded Grand Central Railway with train paths for its own transport services between North-eastern England/Yorkshire and
London by 2026.

Countermeasures in the processing of transport contracts

In the year under review, DB Arriva concentrated intensely
on measures to remedy transport contracts that exhibit
insufficient profitability. These include:
Services provided by DB Arriva in the Greater Stockholm
area. Planned passenger numbers were not attained
within the first half of 2014. In addition, high additional
expenses were required for operations. DB Arriva was
able to clarify some of the contentious issues with the
contracting organization, the Stockholm local transport
authority SL, and is conducting further discussions.
Services operated in Northern Sweden by Botniatåg AB,
a joint venture of DB Arriva with the Swedish state rail­
­way company SJ. Botniatåg, is still in discussions with
the contracting organization.

Investments

>>In January 2014, DB Arriva sold 100% of its shares in
Arriva Malta Ltd., Qormi/Malta, to the country of Malta.
Arriva Malta has not been included in the consolidated
financial statements any more since January 2014.
In order to expand our business in the Czech Republic,
DB Arriva purchased 100% of the shares in CUP TOUR
bus, s.r.o., Příbram/Czech Republic, in February 2014.
Cup Tour has been included in the consolidated financial
statements since March 2014.
In September 2014, DB Arriva sold 100% of its shares in

satisfaction declined slightly
during the year under review due to the poorer availability
of the British rail network. Customer satisfaction in British
bus service improved and had a partially compensatory
effect in overall developments.
Developments in the number of passengers and in
volume sold were positive due to the commencement of
new transport contracts and acquisitions.

Overall, development for the DB Arriva business unit was
slightly positive, with an increase in revenues and in
adjusted EBIT.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to the effects
of acquisitions completed in 2013 (Veolia Eastern Europe,
the Czech bus activities of Abellio, and Centrebus) and the
newly commenced transport services in the Netherlands.
Positive effects from changes in settlements in the UK Trains

The first full-year inclusion of Centrebus led to a rise in the
number of passengers. Volume produced developed negatively in the year under review due to the closure of a few
lines in London.
Revenues development was positive. Growth was driven
by the commencement of new transport contracts, exchange
rate effects (+ € 66 million) and the purchase of Centrebus
in the previous year. A change in fuel subsidies (Bus Service
Operator Grants; BSOG) also led to an increase in revenue.

Gross capital expenditures

This was met, however, with a corresponding increase in
cost of materials. The development of cost of materials was
dampened, yet climbed noticeably overall.
Personnel expenses also increased significantly due to
exchange rate effects and business expansions.
Because revenue growth was almost completely offset
by increases in cost of materials and personnel expenses,
this line of business posted operating profits at roughly the
level of the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted
EBIT increased slightly.
Gross capital expenditures decreased. This was due primarily to lower capital expenditures for buses in London
and for Arriva Transport Solutions.
The number of employees sank as of December 31, 2014,
which was caused chiefly by the restructuring of TGM and
the sale of TOT.

Performance developments during the year under review
proceeded positively, principally because of expanded services in the West of England.
The revenues development was positive during the year
under review. Higher support payments for the cross-country
franchise went together with corresponding increases in
franchise payments (other operating expenses). Effects from
changes in exchange rates also had positive effects (+ € 76
million), yet this was also accompanied by increases in
expenses caused by exchange rates. Growth at Grand Central exercised a supportive effect. Negative revenue effects
resulted from lower grants for Arriva Train Wales, which,

however were accompanied by correspondingly lower trainpath utilization expenses. Developments in cost of materials
were also shaped by exchange rate effects working in the
opposite direction. Cost of materials declined significantly
overall.
In contrast, personnel expenses climbed significantly
because of a higher number of employees, as well as collectively agreed wage increases and exchange rate effects.
Adjusted profit figures improved overall. Adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted EBIT increased.
Gross capital expenditures fell significantly year-onyear.
The number of employees increased slightly due to new
hires.

Detrimental effects also resulted from the higher costs in
the start phase of newly commenced services. Improvements
achieved in Sweden had a positive effect.
Overall, there was a noticeable improvement in the
adjusted profit figures.
Gross capital expenditures rose significantly because of
capital expenditures in the Netherlands for new services as
of December 2014.
The number of employees declined in comparison to
December 31, 2013, because of the sale of Arriva Malta.

The increase in volume sold was a result of the incorporation of the first complete year of transport services in
Sweden and the Netherlands. Growth in bus service is also
due to the first full year of including acquisitions from the
previous year.
Revenues development was positive. The drivers were
acquisitions and the start of new services. The sale of Arriva
Malta had an opposing effect.
The expansion of business, dampened by effects from
the sale of Arriva Malta, was also the main driver in the
development of cost of material and personnel expenses.

The development of the external revenue structure was
influenced measurably by the first full year of including
Veolia Eastern Europe, which was acquired last year. Newly
commenced services also had a positive effect, for example
in Poland. The share of revenues from the Czech Republic,
Poland and Slovakia climbed noticeably. In contrast, the
share from the Netherlands declined, as the increase in
revenues here was disproportionately lower.

Transport and Logistics
DB Schenker Rail business unit
Business model

With around 4,200 customer sidings in Europe, DB Schen­­ker
Rail provides its customers with access to one of the biggest
rail networks in the world and as such is the number one in
European rail freight transport. The international network
stretches along the huge European freight transport cor­
ridor. This means that rail transport is offered across Europe
in the product areas of block trains, single wagons and
combined transport. Individual industry solutions are also
developed, for instance for the chemical, petro­leum, waste
disposal, paper, and iron, coal and steel (montan) industries,
as well as for the automotive industries.
Production is carried out for the most part using our own
fleet of locomotives and wagons.
The key industries for DB Schenker Rail are the iron, coal
and steel (montan) industries, chemical, automotive, and
construction materials industries, heavy industry and con­
sumer goods, as well as intermodal transport. The customer
structure is characterized by major customers.

Development of busine s s units

The premiere key performance indicator here is volume
sold. The relevant capacity utilization figure is measured in
tons per train. The cost structure is mainly influenced by vol­
­ume produced. Due to higher market volatility, there is a
greater need for trains on demand, which cannot be sched­
uled with long lead times. This calls for greater coordination
of sales and production, and for the improved management
of resources based on this.
The most important source of revenue is transporting
goods by rail. Additional services are also offered. DB Schen­
­ker Rail offers its customers customized transport and
logistics solutions which also incorporate links between the
modes of transport rail, truck and ocean freight.
The key resources are close customer loyalty, a high level
of customer understanding, motivated and well-trained
employees along with efficient use of rolling stock and a
premium quality infrastructure. The internal DB Group infra­
structure companies and service providers are important
partners. Cooperation with foreign rail companies is also
important in terms of international connections.

Markets and strategy

Events in 2014

We are constantly expanding the closely-knit international
network with subsidiaries in 15 European countries and
making DB Schenker Rail the leading company in European
rail freight transport.
Economic ≈ dimension: The comprehensive new direc­
tion for the business model aimed at significant improve­
ments in profitability and quality remains in place at
DB Schenker Rail. In addition to the “network rail” which
has been in implementation since 2012 and is making
the production system more stable and efficient and
will also combine flows of traffic more effectively, there
are also plans to harmonize IT and standardize the pro­
cess landscape for the European companies.
	 Projects aimed at increasing reliability, punctuality as
well as customer information and services were launched
for the purpose of increasing customer satisfaction.
	 We want to strengthen our position as a profitable
market leader with a strong European network. Increasing
profitability is required in order to be able to invest
more in the future. Intelligent pricing, more flexibility
of costs, and ongoing productivity increases in all pro­
cesses are crucial.
Social † dimension: In the year 2020, we want to be a
top employer in rail freight transport with a common
European corporate culture. Employee satisfaction should
be increased measurably. In addition to the follow-up
workshops to the first employee survey, we have also,
among other things, initiated the “Step by Step” initiative
for this. We want to expand our network with a strong
international team, and have launched various programs
for this purpose. A large number of measures have been
implemented in the health management area and re­­
gion­­al working time models have been developed further
in order to increase demographic preparedness.
Environmental ¥ dimension: We want to reinforce rail
freight transport as being an environmentally friendly
means of transport. We are developing sustainable trans­
port solutions and modernizing our fleet for this purpose.
By 2020, we aim to have fitted our entire German fleet
of cars with noise-reducing brake shoes. At the same
time, we are committed to climate protection and air
quality control. By 2020, we want to have reduced our
specific energy consumption by 19% compared with
2006. New shunting locomotives are fitted with soot
particle filters and we are also urging the use of hybrid
technology. We are also reinforcing our position as an
eco-pioneer through new CO₂-free offers.

Ongoing refitting of whisper brakes

>>

>>

>>

The comprehensive refitting to the quiet LL brake shoe has
started on schedule as part of our extensive refitting pro­
cess for the entire existing fleets of freight cars consisting
of around 60,000 cars with gray cast iron brakes being
refitted with whisper brakes. Around 5,000 cars have been
refitted to the new LL brake shoe. This means that 14,500
quiet freight cars are underway for DB Schenker Rail as of
the end of 2014 including newly procured freight cars. The
forecast is for around 20,000 quiet freight cars to be in
circulation for DB Schenker Rail by the end of 2015. By 2020
our entire fleet of freight cars will have been converted to
the quiet brake shoes. The refitting, the noise surcharges
for the noise-Based tr ain-path pricing system [page 27 7] and in
particular the additional operating costs, which rise consid­
erably after refitting, will result in great pressure on profit.
First freight train from Hamburg to China

In cooperation with the city and port administration of
Zhengzhou/Henan province, DB Schenker launched a con­
tainer train from Hamburg to the central Chinese metropolis
for the first time in early September. Among other items,
the train loaded with 41 containers transported industrial
robots for an international technology group, but it is also
available to other customers as a multi-customer train. The
train to Zhengzhou completed the 10,214 km journey to
China in around 17 days, making it faster than a ship by more
than 20 days.
Action plan for Germany plus makes a
significant contribution to net profits

The action plan for Germany implemented in 2012 has been
further developed in order to tackle the issue of factor cost
increases and the challenges in German business. In addi­
tion to production-related structural activities, various
measures are also being supplemented with a focus on the
market and customers as part of the action plan for Ger­
many plus.
The target for all actions is increased efficiency accom­
panied by quality improvements.
The measures under the action plan also made a sig­
nificant contribution to profits in the year under review. In
addition to the measures already started in the action plan
aimed at sustained optimization for the control and main­
tenance of our fleet, the additional measures launched for
further cost reductions and process optimization also had
a significant effect.

Within this context, DB Schenker Rail reported a downturn
in the volume of freight carried, the volume sold and the
volume produced. We were able to maintain stable capacity
utilization as a result of measures introduced to increase
efficiency.
∫ The revenues development was more positive than
the development of performance in the year under review,
with revenues slightly higher than the previous year. Devel­
opment in region Central had a positive impact on reve­
nues. Exchange rate effects in Great Britain and the posi­
tive developments in Spain and South-East Europe could
also be felt. The strikes by the GDL and the storm Ela had
the reverse effect.
Other operating income (– 5.1%) decreased partly as a
result of lower proceeds from scrap and lower disposals
from property, plant and equipment.
Cost of material (–1.5%) fell slightly as a result of lower
energy expenses (lower volume produced and more favor­
able weather conditions) and the implementation of mea­
sures from the action plan for Germany plus.

The volume of freight carried and the volume sold decreased
in the year under review. This decrease in volumes was the
result of a weak economy overall, the storm Ela [page 1 5 4]
and the strikes by the GDL [page 11 4 f.]. The positive effects
from the upturn in the economy in the first half of the year
2014 and the lack of negative effects from the floods in
2013 were overcompensated as a result. Volume sold also
fell as a result of a decline in freight carried. However, this
is only just below the value for the previous year as a result
of higher mean transport distance. Volume produced also
fell. In this area, in addition to the development of the
volume sold, the measures implemented led to a further
increase in train utilization, such as with “network rail.”
The revenues development was more positive than the
development of performance. In addition to the conversion
of customer contracts, new business in the petroleum area,
moderate price adjustments along with increased volumes
in seaport hinterland transport and in depot and trucking

G R O U P m a n a g e m e n t r e por t

business also had an impact here. The strikes by the GDL
and the storm Ela had the reverse effect and led in part to
shifts in transport modes.
Other operating income fell, partly as a result of lower
results from scrap proceeds and one-off effects in the pre­
vious year.
Cost of materials fell slightly in the year under review.
Higher purchases of transport services were offset by lower
maintenance expenses and falling energy costs.
Despite a decline in the number of employees, personnel
expenses increased as a result of wage increases and oneoff payments. As a result, operating profit decreased, with
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT both down.
Gross capital expenditures saw an increase essentially
as a result of the new construction of a combi-terminal in
Burghausen and the signing of a long-term finance-lease
agreement for a terminal at the port of Rotterdam. The focus
for the modernization of the fleet of freight cars was on the
purchase of closed automobile transport and double-well
cars. Capital expenditures in shunting locomotives fell, on
the other hand.
The number of employees was lower than the previous
year end due to adjustments in line with the reduced
performance.

Development of busine s s units

The negative performance development in Great Britain
was offset in the revenues development. The good perfor­
mance for all business areas in Spain and the rise in the
construction material area in Great Britain also made their
presence felt. Other operating income remained on a par
with the level in the previous year.
Expenditure development was also put under pressure
by the exchange rate effects. Higher train-path utilization
costs also had an effect on cost of materials in Great Britain.
Transport services procured at Transfesa also increased as
a result of the service expansion. The lower cost of diesel had
a positive effect. The increase in the number of employees
affected personnel expenses. A one-time effect resulting
from adjustment of the pension provision plan in Great Britain
had a positive effect.
Other operating expenses and depreciation rose slightly
above the level for the previous year.
Overall, both the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT
improved.
Capital expenditures rose as a result of exchange-rate
effects and a plant expansion in Great Britain.
The number of employees grew due to an increase in
personnel in France and in Great Britain.

Performance development in region West was weak in the
year under review. The volume of freight carried, the volume
sold as well as the volume produced reported some consid­
erable losses. This was essentially as a result of lower coal
transport in Great Britain, the decline in international inter­
modal traffic as well as the stop on Turkey transports by
Transfesa.

The amount of freight carried fell heavily, primarily as a
result of a change in recording procedures. Operational
development was slightly positive. This also applies to vol­
­ume sold. Declines in Poland (particularly coal transport)
were compensated by the positive development in the
transport business in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Vol­
­ume produced also increased as a result of the positive
business development in the transport area in South-East
Europe.

Revenues development was also positive. The increase was
driven by the development in South-East Europe. Revenue
remained stable in Poland. Other operating income fell,
partly as a result of worse results from the sale of property,
plant and equipment.
Cost of material remained virtually unchanged as against
the previous year. Lower energy costs as a result of lower
diesel costs and falls in train-path usage fees in Poland were
offset by higher levels of transport services procured. The
reduction in personnel expenses was a result of lower per­
sonnel levels in Poland. This was partially offset by the busi­
ness expansion in South-East Europe.
Other operating expenses were lower than in the pre­
vious year, partly as a result of the lack of losses from sales
of property, plant and equipment in the previous year.
Adjusted EBIT fell slightly overall as a result of lower
levels of other operating income.
Capital expenditures rose as a result of a terminal proj­
­ect in Poland.

DB Schenker Logistics has a global customer base in a wide

range of industries and a focus on industrial customers. The
vertical-market approach pursues the target of developing
industry-specific solutions.
In air and ocean freight we act exclusively as freight
forwarder without own planes or ships. Own vehicles and
loading vessels are used for some parts of land transport.
Transshipment terminals and warehouses are generally our
own property or are leased over the longer term.
Motivated and well-trained employees are key resources
for a service provider. Close customer relationships and
industrial expertise are highly important. Efficient IT is also
essential for product and service quality.
In addition to airlines and shipping companies in the air
and ocean freight business, important partners are also
sub-service providers in land transport for carrying out trans­
port services.
Measurement of performance depends on the line of
business: for European land transport, the number of ship­
ments is the key indicator; for air freight, it is the freight
carried measured in tons, while in ocean freight, it is the
freight volume measured in TEU. There is no comparable
volume measured in the contract logistics segment. Market
comparisons are usually performed here on the basis of
revenues. DB Schenker Logistics has a relatively low capital
intensity and real net output ratio. About 70% of revenues
in the transport business come from procured intermediate
input services. Therefore, optimizing these purchase rela­
tionships and balancing various influential success factors
such as transport relations, volume, weight and mode of
transport represent an important factor for success and are
value drivers. Effective IT support is particularly important
here. The same applies to managing fluctuations in freight
rates and the specific surcharges to these freight rates. In
particular, an efficient use of personnel resources, that
proves to be effective, is a key driver below gross profit.
This is of particular importance in contract logistics. Here,
expertise and experience relevant to the industry are an
essential success factor in the optimal design of intra-com­
pany logistics processes.
The most important sources of revenues are transport
and logistics services, including added value services such
as assembly of modules or assemblies in the automobile
industry or putting together special sales packaging for the
retail sector.
Markets and strategy

DB Schenker Logistics holds a leading market position in

every market segment – European land transport, global air
and ocean freight, as well as contract logistics. Our vision is

Development of busine s s units

to be the leading integrated transport and logistics service
provider with a global reach. We want to strengthen and
expand our leading market position.
Economic ≈ dimension: The central challenge is to be able
to respond more quickly to market demand. We rely on
processes for this, which are characterized both through
standardization as well as through industrialization. By
adapting the supply chains consistently, we fulfill cus­
tomer requests and also intensify the customer relation­
ship at the same time. The focus will also be on further
expansion of integrated and innovative solutions for the
entire logistics chain. Our target is to grow profitably
and increase the EBIT margin on a sustainable basis. We
strive towards growing more strongly than the market
in all segments and maintaining our leading market
positions. In pursuing this goal, we are further expanding
and concentrating our global network. There is a partic­
ular focus on the expansion and harmonization of our
global IT landscape.
Social † dimension: We aim to be the top employer in
logis­­tics. Satisfied employees are a basic requirement for
satisfied customers. In order to achieve our targets, we
are strengthening our corporate culture as well as ex­­
panding our individual and international career develop­
ment programs across the entire DB Group. Moreover,
we offer a modern and family-friendly working environ­
ment and diversity. Demographic change presents a wide
range of different challenges to us, which we are actively
dealing with.
Environmental ¥ dimension: We aim to be the eco-pio­
neer in the transport and logistics industry by the year
2020. We will actively build upon our extensive knowhow in green logistics Œ. Through eco-consulting, for
instance, we offer our customers premium consultation
services, through which they can improve their carbon
footprint.

First instance of multimodal transport over three continents

Through combining train, truck and aircraft, we have orga­
nized transport across three continents for the first time
from China to South America for an electronics manufacturer.
A total of 21 tons of electronic equipment for cell phones
was transported by rail from Chongqing in Central China to
Duisburg. From there, they were transported to Frankfurt
Airport by truck and then flown from there to Brazil. The
total time from Asia to South America was re­­duced by almost
four weeks as compared with pure ocean freight.

Ongoing antitrust proceedings

>>Cartel authorities have been investigating companies in
the freight forwarding sector worldwide since the fall of
2007. In DB Group’s 2013 Annual Report, we assumed
that the investigations would have been completed by
the end of 2014, but completion cannot now be expected
before the end of 2015.
The European Commission carried out audits and exam­
inations on two European Schenker companies in 2013.
These are accused of anti-competitive practices such as
pricing agreements and distribution of customers for
transport activities. The examinations have not yet been
completed for the purpose of the allegations. The rel­
evant years are believed to be between 2004 and 2012.
The Cologne state prosecutor’s office is investigating
several DB Schenker employees on suspicion of potential
breaches of the law in association with business rela­
tions with Russia. External attorneys and auditors have
already been involved for a while in the process, which
was launched internally, to clarify the facts. Staff changes
were ordered and compliance structures strengthened.
We are cooperating closely with the law enforcement
agencies.

G R O U P m a n a g e m e n t r e por t

The development of volume in the individual lines of busi­
ness varied during the year under review but was generally
positive:
The volume of shipments in European land transport
increased. This was driven by growth in system opera­
tions and direct transport, which were offset by the slight
slowdown in the package business.
Volumes also increased in air freight. This was essentially
attributable to transatlantic transport, in addition to
transport between Asia and Europe, as well as to and
from Latin America and to the Middle East. By contrast,
volumes fell on the transpacific routes as well as for
transport to and from Latin America.
Ocean freight volumes also increased. Positive develop­
ments were reported particularly in connections within
Asia, transatlantic transport as well as between Asia and
Europe. The development was not offset by the declines
in transpacific connections or for transport within Europe.
The positive performance development resulted in positive

Employee satisfaction remained stable.

A significant reduction in specific CO₂ emissions has been
achieved in ocean transport compared to 2006, in particular
since the implementation of larger ships and sustainable
slow steaming. Land transport and air freight also recorded
reductions as a result of fleet renewals and optimized trans­
port management.

Volumes improved in comparison to the previous year. The
number of shipments in the package business fell by 1.1%,
which was more than offset by the developments in the
system and direct transport business (+ 6.1%).
Falls in average shipping weights and negative exchange
rate effects dampened revenue growth with the result that
overall and external revenues fell slightly.
Cost of materials remained slightly below the previous
year’s level. Once adjusted for exchange rates, the develop­
ments in volumes resulted in higher costs for procured
transport services, particularly for system operations and
direct transport. Personnel expenses also rose due to wage
increases.
Operating profit improved as a result of slight improve­
ments in the gross profit margin and a slight fall in the
numbers of employees despite the growth in shipments.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT both increased overall.
The development of operating profits adjusted for exchange
rates was more positive.
The number of employees remained stable as of Decem­
­ber 31, 2014.

>>In air freight, we were able to expand our transport
between Europe and North America, between Europe
and Asia and from and to the Middle East.
This development was also reflected in the respective con­
tributions to revenue growth. However, this was countered
by exchange rate effects with the result that revenues fell
in this line of business. Nevertheless, we still recorded a
slight increase in revenues adjusted for exchange rates
both for air as well as ocean freight.
The exchange rate effects had a positive impact on ex­­
penditures, since the costs for procured transport services
in particular were lower, on the whole, as a result of this.
While the expense in air freight also fell on account of ex­­
change rates, it rose in ocean freight as a result of the
volume increases.
Personnel expenses fell on account of exchange rates.
Adjusted for exchange rates, these rose slightly as a result
of general salary adjustments.
The development of operating profits was positive both
in air as well as in ocean freight, and adjusted EBITDA and
adjusted EBIT rose.
The number of employees fell as of December 31, 2014.

The revenue development in the contract logistics/SCM
line of business remained positive in the year under review.
Among other things, we recorded markedly good perfor­
mance for existing and new customer business. Negative
exchange rate effects also resulted in weaker development
here. Development in the line of business was even more
dynamic once adjusted for exchange rates. The fall in other
operating income as a result of the inapplicability of a onetime effect in the previous year had a negative effect on
the development of profits.

G R O U P m a n a g e m e n t r e por t

Through the business expansion, cost of materials (par­
ticularly in the regions West and South-East) as well as per­
­sonnel expenses also increased due to the higher number
of employees and wage adjustments.
The development of operating profits was slightly pos­
itive, and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT rose.
The ongoing dynamic business development is reflected
in a further increase in the number of employees.

includes a clear alignment towards the customer and
customer-focused performance fulfillment.
Social † dimension: With the “workforce2020” program,
DB Services is positioning itself as a top employer pre­
pared for demographic change and a preferred service
partner. DB Services works on attractive working condi­
tions and a collaborative corporate culture in order to
increase employee satisfaction on a sustainable basis.
Another focal point is maintaining the health of our em­­
ployees. Examples include the ergonomics concept aimed
at preventing typical work-related diseases and the
“Work mobile” bonus program.
Environmental ¥ dimension: DB Services wants to reduce
CO₂ emissions further. In addition, the DB Services busi­
ness unit advises its customers on the environmental
use of the services and products it offers along its entire
value chain.

2014 to close two maintenance
facilities. This affects around
490 employees in Eberswalde
and around 80 in Zwickau.
DB Group is one of the biggest
employers in Eberswalde. DB Group
is aware of this responsibility
and is offering the relevant
employees other jobs within
DB Group. Several thousand jobs
will need to be filled over the
next few years, for instance as a
result of older employees
retiring. The employees from
Eberswalde and Zwickau
will therefore find a pool of open
jobs if they are suitably
qualified and are flexible in
terms of location.

The Stuttgart – Ulm project moved forward successfully in
several areas during the year under review. Additional
progress was made in assigning construction volume and
the drafting of all planning documents for the Wendlingen –

one of the most important sources for the planning and
progress of construction projects. More than 50 projects
have been prepared for the system, and more are coming
week by week.

DB Netze Track business unit
Business model

DB Netze Track is Europe’s number one track infrastructure

provider. More than one billion train kilometers are traveled
each year on tracks in Germany.
The most important sources of income are earnings
from train-path products, which constitute over 90% of
total revenues. Train-path prices are established on a transparent basis by a train-path pricing system regulated by
the Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway.
DB Netze Track is also responsible for managing infrastructure operations, as well as for securing long-term infrastructure quality and availability and non-discriminatory
access to train-paths and service facilities. This includes
preparing timetables in close cooperation with customers,
operations management, construction management and
maintenance.
The cost structure is determined in particular by fixed
costs. The rail network is one of the most important cost
drivers. The use of resources for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure is very much influenced by specific
facility characteristics, requirements relating to operational opening hours, and the degree of rationalization in
operating business activities. As the dimensions of the
infrastructure only change in the long term due to new or
expansion construction projects or targeted dismantling,
optimal capacity utilization of the existing infrastructure is
of major importance for economic success. A high level of
quality and availability for the train operating companies
also calls for a forward-looking integrated capital expenditures and maintenance strategy. Capacity utilization is
measured by volume produced. In terms of relative network capacity utilization, this figure can be compared to
length of line operated.
For the long-term development of track infrastructure,
it is essential that new and expansion construction projects
concentrate on removing bottlenecks and on the creation
of additional capacities for growth in transport in the main
corridors. The budgetary resources of public authorities, in
particular the Federal Government, are of considerable
importance for the financing of capital expenditures to
replace existing infrastructure, as well as for the financing
of new and expansion construction projects. In this respect,
integration of an entrepreneurial infrastructure into the

d e v e l o p m e n t o f b u s i n e ss u n i t s

Group structure is essential for enabling DB Group to continue making a high contribution to the co-financing of
these infrastructure measures.
Markets and strategy

The contributions made by the Federal Government to
the infrastructure financing are of material importance to
secure the competitiveness of rail as a mode of transport.
A central instrument for this is the LuFV [page 89] .
Economic ≈ dimension: In addition to creating additional capacity, we want to modernize and maintain the
existing rail network efficiently and in line with requirements. Integrating capital expenditures and maintenance planning as well as concentrating construction
sites into corridors and integrating them into the timetable will ensure the most efficient use of resources.
At the same time, we strive to minimize the knock-on
effects for our customers in passenger and freight
transport.
	 We attempt to guarantee high availability and quality of infrastructure in spite of ever-increasing transport
volume. By developing infrastructure in line with customer and market requirements, we enable the entire
rail transport sector to exploit opportunities for growth.
We are incorporating a network development strategy
created on the basis of customer requirements into the
Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. We have established a new infrastructure financing instrument in the
form of the network fund.
Social † dimension: The personnel structure of DB Netze
Track is defined by a high average age; successful recruitment and timely training for our employees is
therefore crucial. In addition, we also take advantage of
the opportunities presented in the collective bargaining
agreement designed to address demographic change;
furthermore, we rely on such methods as flexible work­
­ing time models to improve work-life balance. In order
to sustainably improve employee satisfaction, we are
continuing with the cultural development processes
already underway and promoting a more transformational leadership style.
Environmental ¥ dimension: By implementing both conventional and innovative noise reduction measures and
a noise-based tr ain-path pricing system [page 2 7 7] , we are
making an important contribution to the reduction of
noise pollution caused by rail transport. Furthermore,
we are also reducing our CO₂ emissions – for example,
through the energy-focused renovation of our workshops – and increasingly efficient use of materials and
resources by recycling tracks, ties and ballast.

Events in 2014

Rail cartel lawsuit pending

Alternative variations to Y-track developed

In 2012 and 2013, Germany’s Federal Cartel Office imposed
fines amounting to € 134.5 million against Group companies
from voestalpine, Vossloh and Moravia Steel for anti-competitive collusion in the delivery of rails to DB Group.
In December 2012, DB Group filed a civil lawsuit with
the District Court (Landgericht) in Frankfurt am Main in
con­­­­­­nection with collusion. The lawsuits against Vossloh,
Moravia Steel, and the former owners of Vossloh subsidiary Stahlberg Roensch GmbH are still pending before the
District Court in Frankfurt am Main.

Upon a commission from BMVI, we have investigated five
alternative and supplementary variants to expansion and
new construction lines on the Bremen/Hamburg – Hanover
line (Y-track). The focus was on the question of how to
create more capacity for passenger and freight transport.
In addition to the topics of noise and the environment,
we also assessed feasibility, costs, gains in travel time and
capacity effects.
The Federal Government will conduct an overall economic assessment of these variants on the basis of the
latest transport forecasts for the year 2030.

Damages caused by storm Ela
Special oper ating
conditions

Due to construction activity,
but also because of inclement
weather events such as storms, we
have seen significant impacts
on operations in the past. We have
often not managed to provide
short-notice and consistent information, across all channels, about
schedule adjustments. This was
caused primarily by the fact that
a great deal of information
previously had to be entered
manually into the flow of data,
which caused delays. This is why
we now have a project to improve
customer information. The
project’s implementation began
in early 2015. Since then, new
functions have been tested again
and again on a pilot approach basis.
In the Berlin Südkreuz train station,
for example, our first digital train
location display is in testing; it
will show the arrangement of train
cars for the next four incoming
trains, and will do so in real time.

In 2014 storm Ela caused significant damage to the infrastructure in the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Almost a third of NRW ’s en­­­­­­­­tire
rail network had to be closed.
About 2,200 km of overhead
lines were damaged or destroyed. About 60 heavy clearing and repair vehicles, as well
as 450 employees, were deployed. Damages for DB Group
totaled about € 60 million.
DB Netz wins Digital

Transformation Award

The German weekly business
magazine WirtschaftsWoche,
sponsored by BMVI, awarded
the Digital Transformation
Award for the first time. The
award is given to projects that
make it clear that a company
has understood the challenges
of digital transformation and faced up to them. In the category of “Best Company 2.0,” DB Netz AG won with its new
IT construction kit. One example for these modules is the
network track portal, which enables train operating companies to order train-paths more quickly and easily online,
including cross-border train-paths.

train-path pricing system (TPS) for 2017 at a central customer event. EU directive 2012/34 requires the further
development of TPS , which has to be implemented in
national law by mid-June 2015. The basis for future pricing
schedules is formed by the costs incurred directly by train
operations. To the degree that the market can bear this, DB
Netz AG can raise surcharges to cover the full costs. Distinctions will be drawn among transport volumes and
market segments.
Modernization continues in the existing network

We pushed ahead with the modernization of our existing
network during the year under review, renewing about
3,000 km of tracks, more than 2,300 switches, about 2 million railway ties and about 4 million tons of ballast. We
bundled together the 755 most extensive construction
measures within 65 corridors in order to reduce the number
and duration of suspensions of service due to construction work. This was carried out on the Hanover – Hamburg,
Frankfurt – Fulda, Munich – Salzburg and Karlsruhe – Mannheim lines, and also in the Leipzig rail hub, for example.
During the year under review, the Federal Government
provided an additional € 250 million for maintaining and
renovating infrastructure, especially bridges. LUFV II [page 89]
will bring additional funds into the network in the coming
years.

will replace the Schwarzkopf tunnel as of 2017. The new line
section is about 8 km long. The tunnel’s position reduces
noise emissions significantly.
The Hanau – Nantenbach expansion line is part of the
approx­­­imately 112-km-long Main-Spessart line between
Hanau and Würzburg. This is one of the busiest train-paths
and is used by about 200 trains each day.

New track segment opened between Stelle and Lüneburg

The Stelle – Lüneburg line was expanded to allow more
transports, especially from the ports and for more frequent
regional transport service in the state of Lower Saxony.
Overall, the Federal Government and DB Group invested
about € 350 million in the expansion of the 27-km-long section, which is co-financed by the EU using European
Regional Development Funds. The state of Lower Saxony
was also an investor in station construction. The overall
project included an additional 17 km of newly built sound
barriers for more noise reduction.
Start of construction on the Falkenberg tunnel

Construction began in March on the 2.5-km-long Falkenberg
tunnel. The new tunnel, which consists of two tunnel tubes,
is part of the Hanau – Aschaffenburg – Würzburg line and

Maschen marshaling yard modernized

The Maschen marshaling yard serves as an international
gateway to Scandinavia, with direct connections to Denmark and Sweden, and plays a key role in particular for the
hinterland connection of the major north German seaports.
Over 120 km of track, as well as control technology for
shunting operations, were completely renovated in the last
five years at a cost of more than € 230 million. Today, there
are already up to 150 arriving and departing freight cars
processed every working day in Maschen.

around 72.
In the year under review, train kilometers on track
infrastructure climbed due to higher demand from nonDB Group customers from regional and freight transport.
Adverse effects came from a decline in demand from
DB Group customers, the effects of storm Ela, and the GDL
strikes.
Total revenues increased due to positive price and
volume effects. The development of external revenues,
along with price effects, reflects the increases in demand
from non-DB Group railways, which resulted from newly
won transport contracts in regional transport as well as
from growth in rail freight transport.
Other operating income (–3.8%) fell due to factors in­­

maintenance expenses (storm
Ela and a run-up to maintenance
services). This development was impacted by lower
expenses for winter services and energy.
Personnel expenses (+ 5.3%) rose significantly due to
higher numbers of employees as well as wage increases.

The increase in other operating expenses (+ 5.8%) is attributable to such factors as increased personnel-related and
IT expenses in line with the increase in the number of
employees. Depreciation (+ 5.5%) climbed because of factors such as the absence of reversal effects in connection
with the replacement of defective concrete ties in the previous year.
In total, expense items exceeded revenue growth, so
that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT decreased.
Lower interest expenses led primarily to an improvement in operating net interest income. Accordingly, the
decline in the operating income after interest came out
much lower.
The drop in adjusted EBIT and the slightly increased
amount of capital employed led to a decrease in ROCE.
Increased net capital expenditures and weaker development of profits led to a rise in net financial debt. Adjusted
net financial debt also rose. With a slight reduction in operating cash flow caused by the results, redemption coverage
also deteriorated somewhat.

DB Netze Stations business unit
Business model

DB Netze Stations is the largest station operator in Europe.

In addition to the core business – the development and
operation of stations – the business unit offers mobilityoriented services associated with stations. With over one
million m² of leasing area, we are among Germany’s largest
commercial landlords.
Each day, more than 400,000 trains from 119 customers
bring about eight million passengers into our stations. We
set priorities in the areas of safety, service and cleanliness
so that we can offer customers a high degree of quality.
Railway operations and safety are coordinated through 3S
centers. Station management takes care of facility management and services associated with stations. Operative
facility management services are performed primarily by
service providers inside DB Group.
The cost structure in infrastructure is determined in particular by fixed costs. The number of stopping points is one
of the most important cost drivers. The use of resources
for operation and maintenance is very much influenced by

Business

Stations

specific facility characteristics, requirements relating to
operational opening hours, and the degree of rationalization in operating business activities. Capacity utilization is
measured by the number of station stops.
Sources of income are revenues from station stops (regulated) and income from leasing out commercial space (not
regulated). Revenues from station stops make up about
70% of total revenues.
Key resources include attractive stations and concourse
buildings in central locations. Our most important regulatory partners are the Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway and the
Federal Railway Authority.
Markets and strategy

Passenger stations are increasingly becoming meeting
places in todayʼs mobile society and forming the hub of
intermodal transport systems. With its about 5,400 stations, DB Netze Stations has contributed greatly to this
development.

Our vision of stations as hubs for people and mobility is
tangible in our “Stations2020” strategy.
Economic ≈ dimension: With regard to customer and
quality, we consider the linking of further transport
products to our stations to be a core aspect of the
development of the intermodal transport system of the
future. Stopping points for long-distance buses, and
charging infrastructure for electric cars and e-bikes,
mean that stations also constitute an essential element
of urban infrastructure. In addition to increasing WiFi
access, we are also driving forward the development of
modern video technology and focusing on improving
our customersʼ sense of security. We are continuing to
pursue our goal of improving customer satisfaction by
increasing accessibility and are gradually weatherproofing our stations and providing passengers with
dynamic travel information.
	 Our profitable growth is based on new marketing
concepts, consistent cost management and working
together with partners in leasing.
Social † dimension: Key priorities for us are employee
satisfaction and our employer attractiveness. We
address these topics in the context of fields of action
identified in the course of employee surveys. We regularly include our employees in the “Stations 2020”
strategy and promote development through our training
fund. We are also improving work-life balance through
operating working time projects.
Environmental ¥ dimension: By 2020, we want to have
reduced absolute primary energy consumption by 14%
compared to 2010. We are promoting the use of environmentally friendly facilities and building technologies as
an operator of a complex portfolio of systems. When
modernizing old buildings or constructing new ones, for
example, we investigate the use of innovative lighting
technologies, geothermal energy production, combined
heat and power generation, or photovoltaic systems at
all sites.

Events in 2014

Opening of the green station in Horrem
GRI
EN5
EN6

Europe’s first CO ₂-neutral station was opened in
Horrem in June 2014. This “green station” combines customer comfort with sustainability and serves as a practical
test for innovative technologies. A photovoltaic array with
a surface area of 340 m² delivers CO₂-free electricity with
an output of 31,000 kWh/a. A geothermal system heats and
cools the building by means of a heating pump. The green
‡

roof captures rainwater and uses it for toilet flushing. The
station is made primarily of wood, supplemented by steel
elements. Efficient LED lights and lots of daylight ensure
illumination.
Testing innovation in stations

>>In early 2014, we created an area to try out innovations
in stations, the station of the future at Berlin Südkreuz
[page 27 7] program, to work with partners to test innovative mobility, information and energy concepts. These
innovations include the production of electricity from
renewable energy sources that is then used to power
the station.
In the second half of the year, we piloted a mobility
monitor at the Berlin Südkreuz station that offers dynam­
­ically provided information about connections for different modes of transport. We also launched an electronic display that informs passengers about wagon
location and numbers in real time, including short-notice
changes. Further information is also made available.
Passengers can get information services via video at the
Horrem station. At the push of a button, they are connected with a customer service representative who can
help them. We are testing the acceptance of these services in a pilot project at smaller stations.

>>

>>

Expanding information for passengers

The beginning of September 2014 saw the 6,000th dynamic
visual display (dynamische Schriftanzeiger; DSA) go into
service. There are about 3,800 stations throughout Germany that are now equipped with these displays.
We set up a project in 2014 to create long-term quality
improvements in information for passengers. This program
develops and implements DB Group’s vision and strategic
targets for passengers’ information of the future. The
project is consistently exploiting the opportunities of digitalization to develop and introduce innovative products
and solutions, across all information channels, with the
target of providing consistent, up-to-date and reliable
information for passengers.

>>We concluded a framework agreement with the Federal
state of Bavaria in July that governs the principles and
basic conditions for the realization and financing of further accessibility expansions at passenger stations by
2018.
We concluded a “Lower Saxony is next! 3” framework
agree­­­­­­ment with the state of Lower Saxony and the Lower
Saxony Public Transport Authority in December. The program will continue until 2025.

Successful implementation of construction measures

Numerous station modernizations began or ended in 2014.
The enhancement of accessibility continued to be a priority
topic. A total of 50 stations were renovated with step-free
access.
The feeder level in Hamburg-Altona has been undergoing modernization since January. The entire structural
and technical infrastructure will be renovated by the
end of 2015.
The Hünfeld station was opened in March after accessibility modernization. The Pro-Rail Alliance crowned it
the most attractive small-city station for 2014.

Free WiFi access in stations

It is now possible to enjoy 30 minutes of free WiFi at 126
stations. This service has been well received, with minutes
of usage doubling in comparison to last year. In order to
further improve the WiFi networks, the wireless technology
in the 24 most heavily visited stations was updated.
Development of long-distance bus infrastructure

Our first long-distance bus station was opened in early
2014 at the Berlin Südkreuz station, offering outstanding
connections to other modes of transport in the public network. More long-distance bus stations began operations in
the Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe, Bamberg, Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Berlin Ostbahnhof stations. Additional locations will follow.

Development in the year under review

>>Increase in demand from non-DB Group railways.
>>Expansion in the rental of space.
>>Adverse effects from higher expenses for personnel and
maintenance.
The number of station stops increased during the year
under review due to increased demand from both DB Group
and non-DB Group customers. DB Group-internal growth
was driven primarily by the commencement of operations
of the S-Bahn (metro) Mitteldeutschland network and the
Leipzig city tunnel at the end of 2013.

veyed about their satisfaction.
The positive development shows
that the measures we have implemented to increase satisfaction are now bearing fruit.
The increase in total revenues is due to higher station
revenues resulting from volume and price factors as well as
higher rental and leasing revenues. Expansions in the
leasing business and price effects had a positive effect
here. External revenues also mirrored the increase in
demand from non-DB Group railways and the expansion of
the leasing business.
Other operating income fell significantly as a result of
a decrease in the subsidies awarded for projects. Lower
income from the sale of property, plant and equipment at
unused concourse buildings, as well as reversals of provisions in the previous year, had adverse effects.
The cost of materials rose slightly (+ 0.6%). Higher
maintenance expenses were largely offset by lower
expenses for winter services due to the mild winter and
energy costs.
Personnel expenses (+ 4.1%) increased primarily due to
collective wage agreements. Depreciation (+ 0.7%) remained
nearly unchanged at the previous yearʼs level.

Overall, revenues climbed more significantly than
expenses, which means that the operating profit figures
improved. The positive development of profits, in addition
to a decline in capital employed, led to an improvement
in ROCE. Lower fixed assets were decisive for the decline
in capital employed.

DB Netze Energy business unit
Business model

DB Netze Energy offers all of the conventional industry

energy products in Germany in the fields of traction energy
and stationary energy. These include traction current and
diesel for rail transport, as well as electricity, gas and heat
to stations and other DB Group properties. Furthermore,
DB Netze Energy supplies industrial customers throughout
Germany with a broad array of electricity and gas products.
The service portfolio is rounded out with energy efficiency
consulting and technical services.
The technical backbone of traction current in Germany
is DB Netze Energy’s traction current grid, which offers a
high level of supply reliability. Traction current plants, converters and transformers feed the required electricity into
the traction current network. Grid fees have to be paid for
the non-discriminatory use of traction current network.
These fees are subject to regulation by the Federal Network
Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and

Railway. A second important pillar is the Germany-wide
network of gas stations, some of which can also be used by
road vehicles.
The core competencies of DB Netze Energy are both its
experience in energy efficiency as well as its position as a
integrated provider of energy.
DB Netze Energy offers its customers an increasing
share of renewable energy in the traction current mix.
DB Netze Energy also offers a charging infrastructure for
electric vehicles.
The cost structure in infrastructure is determined in
particular by fixed costs. Among the most important cost
drivers are the type and extent of the infrastructure facilities.
The use of resources for the operation and maintenance of
this infrastructure is very much influenced by specific
facility characteristics and the degree of rationalization in
operating business activities.

Markets and strategy

Events in 2014

The main responsibilities of DB Netze Energy are to guarantee a reliable supply of power to meet the energy require­
ments of train operating companies and the sustainable
procurement of energy. The business unit has a high-performance infrastructure for the provision of electricity and
diesel to mobile and stationary consumers. By means of
structured energy procurement and the effective control
of auxiliary energy costs, our aim is to compensate for the
risks of volatile commodity prices as well as change in
taxes and fees as much as possible.
Economic ≈ dimension: Our excellent level of supply
reliability is the central component of our strategic
direction with regard to customer and quality. Every
year to date, we have exceeded the supply reliability
target agreed upon with the Federal Government in the
LuFV. This quality is also reflected in the high level of
customer satisfaction. We strive to retain this high level
of quality and to continue to offer our customers attractive products in the future.
	 As a profitable market leader in the railway energy
industry, DB Netze Energy uses the know-how available
to it in order to provide market-oriented services to
meet the demand from external industrial and commercial enterprises for qualified assistance in the procurement of electricity and gas.
Social † dimension: DB Netze Energy wants to ensure
a high level of employee satisfaction. We are promoting
an intensive exchange within the business unit and
supporting the cultural development process by means
of transparent information and communication. Furthermore, we have also developed measures to respond
to the challenges of demographic change. For example,
we are taking care to ensure that our employees remain
employable. We also want to improve work-life balance
by offering attractive working conditions.
Environmental ¥ dimension: DB Netze Energy continues
to pursue its vision of meeting 100% of our traction
current requirements with renewable energy by 2050.
Customers today are already able to take advantage of
products based entirely on renewable energy. In order
to meet demand for eco-power, supply agreements
have been concluded for electricity from hydroelectric
and wind power sources. In addition, DB Netze Energy
is also committed to increasing energy efficiency
throughout DB Group and is the driving force behind
innovative energy solutions such as electromobility.

Opening the traction current grid

>>

>>

>>

DB Netze Energy is the first rail infrastructure company in

Europe to fully liberalize traction current supply and to
open up possibilities to change for train operating companies. DB Netze Energy introduced traction current grid
access rules on July 1, 2014 in line with the market, thereby
enabling train operating companies and energy suppliers
to freely choose their electricity provider on the basis of
energy-efficient railway operations regulations.
New traction current pricing system

In December 2013, the EU Commission stopped the cartel
proceedings to review the traction current pricing system
(Bahnstrompreissystem; BPS) due to a commitment
between the EU and DB Group. This commitment anticipates dispensing with volume- and term-related rebates,
unlike the previous BPS . These guidelines were implemented in the new BPS, which was introduced on July 1,
2014. At the same time, the fees published in the new traction current pricing system for the use of the traction current grid by train operating companies are one-to-one with
their individual utilization structure. A so-called backslide
provision is still offered. This is relevant for all train operating companies that do not have a written supplier contract with DB Netze Energy or other traction current suppliers and with which a contract is concluded by conduct
implying an intent to draw traction current from the overhead wire.
Traction current grid becomes a solid-state grid

An electricity energy network (grid) is described as a solidstate grid (SSG) whenever it is entirely or primarily fed by
electronic power converters (transformers, solid-state).
Stable grid operation is carried out by converter-control
algorithms. The mass that is lacking in an SSG enables a
new dimension of energy efficiency. With the commencement of operations of converter blocks in Datteln, the traction current grid has completed a decisive step towards
SSG, because it is especially during low-load times that the
DB Netze Energy grid is fed primarily from converters. This
means that today’s 16.7 Hz traction current grid is the most
modern grid in the world, and also the technological vanguard for future energy systems.

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t

Higher Renewable Energy Sources Act surcharge

Contrary to the practice to date, the surcharge in accordance with the Renewable Energy Sources Act [page 90] will in
the future cover all traction current, i.e. also the 16.7 Hz
energy generated at the traction current plants.

from DB Group customers in passenger and rail freight
transport, which could only be partially counterbalanced
by increases with regard to non-DB Group customers. Efficiency improvements, increased intermodal competition,

customers increased significantly in the stationary energy
field. Lower energy needs from internal DB Group customers had an opposite effect.
Rising sales volume to non-DB Group customers also
dominated revenue development. Total revenues were
adversely affected by price effects from lower energy
prices, as well as a decline in demand from DB Group customers. Efficiency improvements also contributed to the
decline in energy consumption. Other operating income
(+25.6%) increased primarily because of additional income
from intra- DB Group services, especially grid operating
services as a result of last year’s takeover of the traction
current supply facilities of the S-Bahn (metro) in Berlin.
The cost of materials (+2.3%) rose due to volumerelated higher electricity purchasing expenses, as well as
adverse effects from higher energy surcharges. Lower

nance strategy.
A regulation-related adjustment of the useful life of selected energy facilities to electricity grid fee schedule led to
a significant decline in depreciation (–24.4%).
Overall, these expenditures resulted in a decline in
operating profit figures. The profit development, accompanied by a slight rise in capital employed, led to a significant decline in ROCE.
Net financial debt increased significantly due to higher
funds commitment in working capital. Redemption
coverage decreased noticeably in connection with the
declining development of profits.
Net capital expenditures increased because of such factors as the German Unity Transport Projects (VDE) 8 and

>>In May 2014, DB ML AG purchased 100% of the shares of
Barnsdale Cartel Damage Solutions AG. Barnsdale is a
special-purpose vehicle for asserting claims for damages
caused by a cartel, and it has been included in the
consolidated financial statements since June 1, 2014.

Business development
The Other/consolidation item primarily comprises the
holding companies DB AG and DB ML AG, as well as other
companies that cannot be allocated to a business unit. The
increase in total revenues (+€ 69 million or + 4.1%) was
largely the result of an increase in internal services from
DB Stuttgart – Ulm Project. Accordingly, consolidation
effects also increased slightly (€ –73 million or + 0.7%).
Lower internal revenues at DB Netze Energy were overcompensated for by increased internal revenues at DB Netze
Track, DB Netze Stations and DB Services.
The negative development of adjusted EBITDA and
adjusted EBIT resulted from such factors as business developments at DB Netze Projects and DB Sales. Higher cost of
material and central projects also impacted developments.

Procurement contributes to Group objectives
As a central Group function the Procurement division makes
an essential contribution to implementation of the strategic
Group objectives within the scope of the DB2020 strategy,
and ensures that the business units obtain supplies using
operational excellence and with optimum quality, logistics
and costs.
By achieving purchase potentials we are able to make
a contribution to the group target of profitable market
leader Æ . The trend for comparatively high wage agreements in Germany continued in the year under review. To­­
gether with increases to the minimum wage and a rise in
prices administered by the state (for example civil service),
this continues to lead to high pressure on prices, particularly in the service sector. Price effects based on changes
to the cost of raw materials remained largely inapplicable.
We are supporting the target of becoming a top em­­
ployer † by implementing additional professional career
models in the Procurement division. All employees in the
relevant areas gain a clear insight into potential development pathways and the competencies associated with
these as a result of the professional career model. We have
developed target-group specific qualification programs
over several days for the purposes of providing training for
these competencies which we are also implementing.
Via the systematic work in the goods group strategy we
are supporting the business units in making potential interactions between individual strategic objectives transpar­­ent.
This is an essential step in becoming an eco-pioneer ¥. The
extent to which the environmental objectives of DB Group

G R O U P m a n a g e m e n t r e por t  Add i t i o n a l i n f o r m at i o n

are relevant is being examined systematically for the groups
of goods. If there is a high degree of relevance then measures are determined in coordination with the business units
in order to ensure the environmental objectives of the business units using procurement and contract award strategies.
The areas of rolling stock procurement and rolling stock
spare parts were merged in 2014 so that the Procurement
division will be capable of implementing its corporate mission for the DB Group units in an even more targeted and
effective manner going forward.
Procurement as a building block
for sustainable development

With the launch of the DB2020 strategy, Procurement has
placed a greater focus on sustainable criteria and has started
to concentrate on future challenges.
As a result of its appropriate procurement and award
strategies, Procurement is already a central building block in
enshrining consistent sustainable development in DB Group.
Yet in addition to our own added volume we also want to
encourage environmental and social standards in the supply
chain together with suppliers.
Procurement has a lot of influence on market events
and on the competitiveness of DB Group.
Expansion in internationalization

Central Procurement is adapting to an increasingly global
and heterogeneous supplier structure as a result of the on­­
going internationalization of DB Group. Heterogeneous
supplier selection enables the spreading of risk and allows
competitive profitability to be maintained.
The advantages of the emerging procurement markets,
particularly in Asia and Eastern Europe, were exploited for
individual groups of goods in a targeted manner in the year
under review. A DB Group-wide bundling of needs across all
relevant business units also makes sense from an environmental point of view. Central Procurement already defines
the fundamental guidelines and processes for the international business units today. International procurement
teams are an additional tool in internationalization.

Cartel proceedings due to ticket sales

The Federal Cartel Office opened proceedings against
DB AG on grounds of the suspected abuse of a marketleading position in the sale of tickets for rail passenger
transport. In this context, the Federal Cartel Office has sent
a questionnaire requesting information on tariff and sales
cooperation with other train operating companies as well
as sales commissions and sales channels. We are co­­operating
fully with the Federal Cartel Office and provided our re­­
sponses to it on the questionnaire on March 14, 2014. DB AG
has not yet received a written response from the Federal
Cartel Office. The Federal Cartel Office has also re­­­­quested
in­­formation about market conditions and the behavior
DB AG is accused of from other local/long-distance rail passenger transport companies as well as from the collective
bargaining association of Federally owned and non-Federally owned railway companies in Germany.

OPPORTUNITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT
WITHIN DB Group
The principles of risk management are laid down by
the Group headquarters and implemented throughout
DB Group. As part of our early-warning system for risks,
quarterly reports are submitted to the Management Board
and the Supervisory Board of DB AG . Major risks occurring outside of this reporting cycle must be reported immediately. Planned acquisitions are subject to additional
specific monitoring.
Our risk management system (RMS) maps all of the risks
in a risk portfolio and also individually in detail, factoring
in materiality thresholds. The risks considered within the
risk management report are categorized and classified
according to probability. Together with possible consequences, the analysis also takes into account the starting
position and the cost of countermeasures. In organizational
terms, Group controlling is the central coordination point
for our risk management system.
In conjunction with Group financing, with its strict focus
on the operating business, Group Treasury is responsible
for limiting and monitoring the resulting credit, market and
liquidity risks. The centralized handling of the relevant
transactions (money market, securities, foreign exchange

and derivative transactions) by DB AG means that potential
risks can be managed and limited centrally. Group Treasury
is organized in line with the minimum requirements for risk
management formulated for banks (Mindestanforderungen
an das Risikomanagement; MaRisk), which means that it
complies with the resulting criteria of German Law on Corporate Governance and Transparency (Gesetz zur Kontrolle
und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich; KonTraG).
Our opportunity management efforts are mainly derived
from the targets and strategies of our business units. Operational management personnel in the business units are
primarily responsible for the early and regular identification, analysis and management of opportunities. These
activities are an integral element of the Group-wide planning and controlling system. We focus intensely on detailed
analyses of our markets and competitors, market scenarios,
relevant cost drivers and critical factors for success,
including those within our political and regulatory environment. Concrete opportunities for specific business units
are identified and analyzed from these.

Key characteristics of internal control
and risk management with regard to Group
accounting process
Our RMS is complemented by a Group-wide internal control
system (internes Kontrollsystem; IKS) that also includes
the accounting process. To the extent that compliance is
deemed to be appropriate, the components of our IKS take
into account the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) publication: “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” in its
revised version of 2013. The COSO model is a generally
accepted theoretical framework that divides an IKS across
all levels of an organization into five essential components and assesses them individually. Based on this, our
accounting-related IKS is a continuous process, based on
fundamental mechanisms such as system-technical and
manual coordination, separate and clear definition of functions and monitoring of compliance and further development of guidelines and specific operating procedures that
are applicable throughout the Group.
In addition to the instruments listed above, the accounting-related control mechanisms include a Groupwide, uniform reporting system based on standard Oracle
Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) software and regular updating of the relevant accounting directives and
accounting systems.
The auditing activities of the intra-Group auditors,
which represent a key element of our control mechanisms
in the form of a process-independent monitoring instrument, are focused on evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of our IKS. Auditing measures are taken as well
when the stocktaking of property, plant and equipment as
well as inventories is done. In addition to these measures,
the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory
Board monitor the accounting process and the effectiveness of the IKS.
In line with a binding schedule, the accounting-relevant
issues are dealt with in the local accounting departments,
which for the most part use standard software in line with
IFRS principles and in compliance with Group-wide, uniform
procedures. These are then transmitted to the centralized
HFM system.
The management of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements and of the individual business units verifies among others the completeness and
correctness of data relevant to the financial statements,
using a quarterly internal reporting process. Confirmation

is also given that the executives responsible have implemented the centrally defined IKS for reporting and, where
appropriate, have supplemented these with their own documented control and monitoring instruments.

Management assessment of the risk situation
The assessment of the current risk situation is based on
our RMS. During the year under review, the key risks of
DB Group were in the areas of personnel, regulation, the
economic climate, market and competition. Compared to
the previous year, the overall risk position in relation to the
forecast for the respective following year reduced slightly
in the year under review (€ – 0.2 billion).
For the forecast of development in the 201 5 financial year
[page 181 ff.] including countermeasures, risks amounting
to € 0.9 billion exist (thereof very likely (vl): € 0.4 billion).
These risks are primarily due to the areas of personnel
(€ 0.4 billion; thereof vl: € 0.3 billion), regulation (€ 0.3 billion; thereof vl: € 0.0 billion) as well as the economic
climate, market and competition (€ 0.1 billion; thereof vl:
€ 0.0 billion).
Third-party assessments also play an important role in
the overall risk assessment. Alongside the internal risk
assessment system, the DB Group’s creditworthiness and
default risk is rated by r ating agencies [page 100] Moody’s
and S&P. Their external assessments of the overall risk
position of DB Group are reflected in the good ratings.
Our analyses of risks, countermeasures, hedging and
precautionary measures, together with the opinion of the
Group Management Board based on the current risk assessment and our medium-term planning, indicate that there
are no risks that, individually or jointly, could have an
impact on the net assets, financial or earnings position of
DB Group and would pose a threat to the Group as a going
concern.
In terms of organization, we have created all of the conditions necessary to enable the early identification of possible risks. Our continuous risk management and the active
management of key risk categories help limit risks within
DB Group.
Key strategic opportunities and risks were identified
at the business unit level and stored in the course of the
SMP for operationalization with measures.

Our business activities bring not only opportunities, they
also carry risks. For this reason, our business policy aims
to take advantage of opportunities while also actively
managing any risks identified within the framework of our
risk management system.
The information processing required for this takes place
within our integrated RMS. The system is based on the
requirements of the KonTraG and is continually evolving.
During the year under review there were no major methodological changes to that system.
Opportunities and risks arise in particular from trends,
framework conditions and performance. Key strategic
opportunities and risks were identified at the business unit
level and stored in the course of the annual SMP [page 72] for
operationalization with measures. The SMP is the central
platform for the development and definition of strategies
for DB Group and its business units. It ensures the development of an integrated, Group-wide strategy and provides
the linkage between strategy and planning.

Major opportunities and risks
Economic climate, market and competition
Key topics: Development of macroeconomic fundamentals/
the economic environment, inter- and intramodal competition, ordered services market for regional transport services,
service offerings, penalties in regional transport, rental and
sale of real estate
Demand for our mobility services and, in particular, for our
transport and logistics services is dependent on overall
economic development, among other things:
Economic growth fuels the trends underlying our strategy in our operating markets.
Macroeconomic shocks such as economic and financial
crises and economic fluctuations may adversely affect
our business.
The development of key economic factors (such as disposable income or number of persons in active employment) is particularly relevant for passenger transport.
Risks arising from the sovereign debt crisis could have
adverse effects (particularly in the form of spending
cuts), primarily on our activities in the DB Arriva business unit.

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t O p p o r t u n i t y a n d r i s k r e p o r t

Developments in the competitive environment are of particular importance for DB Group:
In long-distance transport, we are involved in tough
inter- and intramodal competition, particularly with
motorized individual transport as the dominant competitor, but increasingly also with long-distance bus
services. Increased competition has a negative impact
on price perception. This can lead to planned price
measures only being partially implemented or even not
at all.
There is intense competition in regional transport
throughout Europe for securing long-term contracts.
The market volume here is greatly determined by the
financial situation of the contracting organizations. The
future financing of regional rail passenger transport
beyond the year 2015 is currently being discussed on
the basis of draft legislation in the Federal and state
Governments.
	 There is here the risk of losing tenders. To be able to
succeed in this market, we are constantly working to
optimize our tender management and our cost structure.
What is more, depending on the contract type, there is
also the risk of a loss of passengers without the possibility of being able to adapt the operating schedules.
∫ There is fierce intramodal and considerable intermodal competitive pressure in rail freight transport.
Risks arise from the fact that competitors can operate
with less expensive cost structures at the same time
as enjoying greater flexibility. To address factor cost
increases and business challenges in Germany, the
Action Plan for Germany [page 1 4 0] will be continued and
supplemented by additional structural measures.
∫ A key component in order to face the competition is improvements in quality of service. Significant opportunities
arise from the trend towards digitalization:
We can use this to make processes in passenger transport more efficient and customer-focused.
Customers can be offered new and improved digital services, for example in the field of passenger information.
Online portals and apps facilitate access for customers,
but also alter the price perception of mobility services.

Key sales market opportunities and risks also result from
foreseeable changes in the competitive situation:
With the rise of the sharing economy, more mobility service providers and rising cost transparency, price perception of mobility services is changing. Digital platforms are increasing cost transparency across all modes
of transport. This offers the opportunity that public
transport usage will become more intensive compared
with a private car. But higher quality mobility services
are feeling the squeeze, for example, from low-priced
carpooling and the online cost comparisons.
New online portals may result in the loss of the customer interface.
The actual brokerage of transport capacity by transport
firms could be taken over successively by online services, such as online booking platforms. In addition, it
would be possible to exploit the high volume levels on
booking platforms for grouping purchasing.
We are responding to opportunities and risks arising from
changing demand patterns and from shifts in traffic patterns throughout the Group with intensive market observation and by continuously upgrading our portfolio and our
products:
∫ The growth of the sharing economy may provide an
opportunity to increase customer loyalty to public transport, particularly among young people. Car sharing
allows a mobile life without owning a car. By offering
services to this group, DB Group can exploit this change
in mobility behavior.
Digital innovations are opening up the possibility of
enhancing existing products with value-added services
or developing completely new logistics services. 3- D
printing, for example, has potential in this regard. In any
case, this will avoid the need for some transport in the
future, which will lead to a fall in transport volume.
Structural changes to our customers’ production structures, as our customers are frequently faced with international competition.
Change in customers’ willingness to pay; traction (especially block trains and combined transport), for example,
will become a commodity with low margins.
Relocation and fluctuations in the importance of industries and markets requires the existing portfolio and its
orientation to be continuously kept under review and
developed. This leads to risks and opportunities, primarily in the logistics field.

The demand for our products and services is partly dependent on the development of our customersʼ sales markets:
Our customersʼ economic development dictates their
need for storage and transport services, which in turn
affects our freight forwarding and logistics businesses.
Our activities are affected in particular by the very competitive nature of the market. We are responding to this
by further expanding our networks and improving our
cost structures, services and IT infrastructure.
∫ Rail freight transport is partly dependent on industries
that are stagnating. The decline of coal as an energy
source in Germany, for example, is having an effect.
The development of demand in rail infrastructure is
dependent on rail transportʼs ability to compete on the
upstream transport markets.
Opportunities arise from new prospects due to change in
our markets:
The increasing networking of different modes of transport affords an opportunity to develop stations into central mobility hubs between different transport networks.
New market segments are being created along the transport chain by new competitors such as long-distance bus
services (by expanding long-distance bus stations at
railway stations, for example).
∫ The liberalization of the value chain for rail freight
transport has created new market segments (such as
rental of locomotives, rail cars and personnel as well as
maintenance). Here we can record additional growth
from existing resources (for example car fleet and workshops) and economies of scale.
Opportunities and risks arise throughout DB Group from
the potential exploitation of big data:
Big data analytics offers the chance to better understand
our customer portfolio and optimize the way we approach
customers through, inter alia, customer segmentation
based on big data analytics (“predictive selling”) and
adjustment of our portfolio of services through improved
transparency when it comes to customer data.
∫ New, efficient competitors from outside the transport sector with a thorough understanding of the digital economy could establish themselves as independent players in the transport market. With a high
capacity to innovate and sizable financial resources, it
is mainly companies from the ICT sector which pose a
risk for incumbents.

Production and technology
Key topics: possible technical malfunctions, technology risks
(vehicles, infrastructure, IT and telecommunications) increased maintenance requirements, risk of customs offenses
and thefts, noise abatement
If the quality of long-distance transport services suffers,
this has an impact on production and service quality and
can lead to the loss of customers. The postponement of
delivery of new rolling stock causes revenue losses and
additional costs.
The availability and the condition of rail infrastructure
are a key prerequisite for the performance capabilities of
rail transport. Building work on the network affects schedules and the production quality of carriers, part of which
cannot be compensated.
In regional transport, a risk can arise from the redundancy of vehicles following the expiry or re-tendering of a
transport contract. As a countermeasure, alternative possible uses are checked continuously.
To an increasing extent, the business processes of
DB Group are dependent on highly available and secure
information technology. In the future, an increasing proportion of business processes will be dependent on IT. This
dependence also entails potential risks such as a break in
the availability of IT systems or hacking of customersʼ data.
Our forward-looking IT management ensures that the necessary security measures are in place for our IT-based business processes. An important method for this is IT risk management for applications, infrastructure and services. The
relevant risks are systematically analyzed, evaluated and
eliminated or minimized. Residual risks are documented,
reported to the competent department as applicable, and
monitored. The IT risk management of DB Group follows
the internationally accepted ISO 27000f standard.
Loss of income and damage to image can result from
credit card fraud or in the event of the online sales channel
malfunctioning. In order to avoid critical gaps in security,
appropriate countermeasures (such as firewalls, encryption and reserved areas of servers) have been implemented. In order to ensure high availability of IT operations, we use redundant operational and data backup
systems distributed across different locations, fail-safe
systems, outsourced tape backup and separate administration structures. Our wide area network (WAN) in particular
is redundantly designed wherever IT security and business

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t O p p o r t u n i t y a n d r i s k r e p o r t

continuity require this. These measures reduce the risk of
IT system failures and avoid large-scale disruptions, ensuring that mission-critical business processes are operational
at all times.
Sufficient availability of our vehicle fleet [page 1 30] is
essential for our operations. Significant reductions in vehicle
availability pose a threat to operating schedules. We try to
minimize this risk by taking preventative actions and also
by minimizing the consequences should it happen, such as
by providing replacement vehicles or by organizing replacement transport services.
In regional transport, there is the additional risk of penalties imposed by the relevant contracting organizations if
trains are canceled or punctuality targets are missed.
Punctuality [page 160] is a key factor for rail freight transport customers when selecting a mode of transport. In
addition to this, irregularities can occur during operations,
such as customs offenses and theft. We combat these risks
with measures such as employing qualified customs coordinators and using a system of immediate reporting for tax
assessment notices.
The range and quality of our services depend to a significant extent on the availability and reliability of the production resources used, intermediate services procured
and the quality of our partnersʼ services. We therefore keep
up an intense dialog with our suppliers and business partners on the subject of quality. This is of particular importance in the vehicle industry.
The technical production resources used in rail transport must comply with applicable standards and requirements, which are subject to change. As a result, we may
receive technical complaints concerning our vehicles. This
leads to the risk that we may only be permitted to use individual series or rail car types under certain conditions, such
as limited speeds, shorter intervals between maintenance
or reduced wheel set loads. In addition, we cannot accept
newly purchased vehicles that have flaws or for which the
necessary vehicle certification has not been granted.

Personnel
Key topics: future collective bargaining agreements, Groupwide labor market, pension commitments
F1
 P. 116
P. 176

To be able to hold our own against the competition, our
staff cost structure plays an important role. Our target is
always to conclude competitive collective agreements in
terms of the labor market and the transport market.
∫

Due to demographic changes and the associated lack of
skilled employees, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
fill vacancies with qualified personnel. This in turn leads to
risks such as lack of know-how transfer and the restriction
of opportunities for career development.
Our life-phase-oriented personnel policy gives us the
opportunity to promote loyalty among employees. Flexible working time models and jobs designed specifically for
the age of the employee contribute to this, as do the job
security we offer and our intensive work on the corporate
culture.
Diversity in the workforce can lead to more creativity
and productivity. Young employees bring new ideas and
concepts into the working routine. Older employees have
varied and extensive experience, and pass on their knowledge to new groups of employees. In addition, in mixed
teams, new perspectives and viewpoints are contributed to
the solution-finding process. In the long term, and in an
appropriate corporate culture, this can have an impact on
the innovation capacity and performance of DB Group.

Regulation
Key topics: possible government intervention or changes in
the regulatory environment (access, pricing and the railwayspecific infrastructure in question unbundling requirements).
Regulation to the detriment of rail, for example due to
additional legislative requirements, endangers intermodal
competitiveness. Changes to the legal framework at national or European level could pose risks to our business.
This general regulatory risk could result in tangible negative effects on revenues and profit.
DB Group provides rail transport services in a regulated
market. These regulations govern the individual components of the pricing systems, and general terms and conditions applied by our rail infrastructure companies. Risks in
this regard are complaints and intervention. Measures that
threaten or even prevent DB Group from attaining reasonable returns in our infrastructure business units (such as
intervention in pricing systems) make it more difficult to
control these activities from a business perspective and
can therefore threaten financing contributions by DB Group
to infrastructure capital expenditures.

Political risks concern particularly a tightening of existing standards and regulations affecting the railways. The
structure of DB Group may also expose it to regulatory
risks. These could arise on a national or a European level.
In order to respond to risks resulting from changing
legal framework conditions on either a national or international level, we take an active part in the discussions and
debates that take place ahead of this type of change.

Procurement/energy market
Key topics: Price trends for external procurement markets,
possible full auctioning CO ₂ certificates
Rising energy prices are threatening the intermodal competitive advantage of rail. Purchase prices for raw materials,
energy and transport services vary according to market
conditions. This means that depending on the market conditions and our competitive situation, it may not be possible
or may only be possible to a very limited extent to pass in­­­
creased costs on to the customer in the short term. This in
turn has a negative impact on margins.
We respond to the risk of increasing energy prices by using appropriate derivative financial instruments [page 222 ff.]
and entering into long-term procurement contracts. However, these safeguards also limit opportunities arising from
trends in energy prices. In the event of falling energy prices,
we do not benefit from the market trend and could lose
intramodal competitiveness.
Due to the heavily electricity-biased energy mix of
DB Group, changes in oil prices have no significant effects.
However, changes in electricity prices, for example due to
the EEG levy, can have a significant impact on results.
Noticeable train-path price increases by national infrastructure operators outside of Germany (for example in
France) result in costs for the use of infrastructure rising
significantly. Due to the intensity of competition, it is not
always possible to pass on cost increases.

Capital markets and taxes
Key topics: Interest and currency risks
The expansion of our international business brings currency
risks with it. This risk, however, is largely limited to the socalled translation risk, since usually there is a high regional
congruence between the production and sales markets. We
use original and derivative financial instruments as one

means of countering interest rate, currency and energy
price risks from our operating business. These instruments
are discussed in the notes. There is a risk that these hedging
measures will not pay off, or not in the way expected.
To prevent the counterparty default risk from financial
and energy derivatives, we conclude credit support agreements (CSA) for all hedges.
Pensions and similar retirement benefit obligations are
partially covered by plan assets from stocks, real estate,
fixed-income securities and other investments. Value losses
in these assets directly reduce the cover of pension obligations by plan assets, potentially resulting in the company
having to provide additional cover.
In addition, there are potential risks from back-tax payments from tax audits that are in progress.

Law and contracts
Key topics: Compensation claims, lawsuits, active and passive claims
As a result of delayed vehicle deliveries and vehicle defects,
operating difficulties and breaches of contract or non-compliances arise with respect to contracting organizations.
Higher expenditures and penalty payments combined with
lower fares are the result. Damages claims against the manufacturers were therefore initiated or are in preparation.
Provisions have been made for legal and contractual risks
based on an assessment of their probability of occurrence.
Opportunities arise from the discovery of cartels that
operated in the past and the enforcement of claims for
damages against cartel members.
Compliance with current laws, company guidelines and
recognized regulatory standards is the task and duty of
every DB Group employee. It is the mission of our Compliance department [page 55] to ensure compliance with such
criteria.
Large-scale capital expenditures mean that the Infrastructure division is exposed to a significant risk of becoming the target and victim of corruption, cartel agreements
or fraud. As a third-party provider of financing, the Federal
Government is placing high demands on DB Group with its
anti-corruption guidelines.

G ROUP m a n a g e m e n t r e p o r t O p p o r t u n i t y a n d r i s k r e p o r t

Significant events
Key topics: Disasters and accidents, sabotage, extortion
Our activities as a train operating company are based on a
technologically complex, networked production system. In
general, we try to combat the risk of potential operational
disruptions through regular maintenance and by taking on
qualified employees, coupled with continuous quality
assurance and improvement of our processes. The nature
of rail transport as an open system means that certain factors (such as accidents, sabotage and theft) over which we
have only limited influence could have a negative impact
on operations. Our efforts in such cases focus on minimizing the potential effects. However, this could also result
in cost risks from countermeasures.
Increasing damage to infrastructure by the accumulation of extreme weather events due to climate change lead,
inter alia, to loss of income due to reduced services due to
weather-related breakdowns and increased need for expenditures on preventive measures.
In order to adapt the means of production to extreme
weather phenomena and to avoid restricted operating
quality due to weather damage, DB Group is working with
national and international experts on the adaptation of
external technical regulations to altered climatic conditions. In addition, DB Group is reviewing its own rules
bearing in mind the impact of a changing climate.

Other issues
Project risks

Our measures involve not only in part huge capital expenditure volumes, but also a large number of highly complex
projects. Changes in the legal framework, delays in implementation (including due to ever-more comprehensive
public consultation), necessary adjustments during the
frequent multi-year project periods or deviations from the
ramp-up curves agreed with the Federal Government for
the capital expenditures funds available can lead to project
risks. The networked production structure means that
these can often affect a number of business units. For
example, in such cases planned modal shifts from road to
rail will not be feasible. Due to the budget carry-forward
principle agreed with the Federal Government, no funding
was lost due to procedural delays.

17 5

Also price increases in bought-in services or for construction can have negative consequences and may lead, for
example, to liquidity risks. We keep up to date with this by
closely monitoring projects. This applies in particular to
large, centrally managed projects.
Infrastructure Financing

As a key element of the German Rail Reform the
Federal Government has enacted a constitutional obligation to finance the capital expenditures in rail infrastructure. The main criterion is the provision of sufficient amounts
of funding, but also the ability to plan the financing available in the future. In addition to the risk of a lack of available funds for financing capital expenditures, there is also
a risk of insufficient funds for the adequate maintenance of
the existing network. The economic sustainability of capital
expenditures or financial contributions to capital expenditure projects funded with DB funds is essential if we are to
ensure DB Groupʼs ability to invest in the long term.
We have an agreement with the Federal Government
that sets out the financing of the existing network until
2019. The higher funding of the LuFV II [page 89] and the
associated long-term safeguarding of infrastructure quality
and availability increase the attractiveness of rail as a mode
of transport. Positive effects from this could be felt in
higher revenues from the infrastructure companies. The
profits of infrastructure companies in turn are plowed back
into the infrastructure via the funding cycle. Risks arise
from a possible failure to achieve the quality targets set out
in LuFV II.
However, to ensure the long-term competitiveness of
rail as a mode of transport, sufficient financial means must
be available to ensure systematic new construction and
expansion as well as to eliminate bottlenecks (requirement
plan capital expenditures).
There is also the risk that the Federal Government could
reclaim its funding on the basis of an audit of exactly how
the Federal funds were used.

Key Issues and Actions

>>Growth programs have already been adopted for land
transport, ocean and air freight and initial analyses have
been drawn up of various vertical markets. Currently, a
review is being carried out of the market attractiveness
of the parcels business as well as the development of a
parcels strategy for DB Schenker Logistics with a focus
on Europe.
∫ We are responding to the industry development in rail
freight transport by further internationalization and the
increased focus on growth sectors – such as combined
transport. We are carrying out a number of initiatives to
further expand our European network. To strengthen
combined and multimodal transport, the Transport and
Logistics division has set up the Multimodal Competence Center. This Center is hard at work on boosting
growth and efficiency in combined transport. New products and services are currently being developed. In addition, we have initiated several projects to develop new
market segments within the value chain of rail freight
transport.

Digitalization
F5
 P. 172

The digitalization affects almost every aspect of life. Information and communication technologies are having
ever-increasing influence. For mobility and logistics providers, it is increasingly important to digitalize products.
We are responding with three initiatives:
Shaping the future of mobility is the subject of the
Mobility 4.0 initiative [page 24 ff.] . The target is to develop
products to meet future customer requirements in a
fast and implementation-oriented way. For this purpose, an Innovation Lab has been founded.
Infrastructure 4.0 is about digital images of reality.
Tracks, switches and signals are increasingly available as
digital building blocks. Algorithmic calculations also
allow automated route mapping, in other words the comparison of customersʼ preferred schedules with the free
capacity in the network. This will lead to faster, more
efficient route planning. The digitalization of infra­structure will increase network capacity, make rail transport
more flexible, contribute to more stable punctuality and
improve passenger information.
In the transport and logistics sector, we want to use
Logistics 4.0 to connect all the process steps though
intelligent IT and enable customized logistics solutions
from a single source. An inter-business-unit working
group has been set up to optimize, inter alia, the customer interface and introduce a standardized customer
app.
	 Innovations such as 3-D printing could also potentially lead to new services with an impact on transport
flows.
In order to better coordinate DB Groupʼs activities in the
field of digitalization, we have also created a unit with horizontal responsibilities in the division reporting to the CEO.

Market development
DB Group is active in attractive markets with good growth
prospects:
With DB Arriva, we have a strong position in the European transport market. We have also positioned ourselves in such a way that we are well prepared to take
advantage of the opportunities posed by open and
opening markets. As a result of the sovereign debt crisis
in Europe, we see opportunities in increased tender procedure activities for bus and rail transport in countries
where their governments are forced to implement austerity measures. In addition, there is the possibility that
new markets or market segments will be opened for
competition.

Demography
The trends of demographic change, diverse lifestyles, our
achievement-oriented society and the war for talent all put
their special mark on our HR management. With our HR 2020
strategy we give answers on how to make HR management
fit for the future.
For example, we counter demographic changes by giving
employees the opportunity to design their working time
and working conditions flexibly, such as with long-term
work accounts and sabbaticals. We also have numerous
innovative pilot projects that offer our employees custom-fit ways to transition to flexible working hours.
We meet the diverse lifestyles and the trend to an
achievement-oriented society by offering ways to make
family and personal life more compatible with part-time
management and much more. In addition, we have been
working continuously on further developing our corporate culture.
In order to stay ahead in the war for talent we work
intensively on our appearance and our attractiveness
as an employer. To identify possible bottlenecks early
enough so as to react in the appropriate manner, we
rely on strategic personnel planning which gives a tenyear forecast.

Implementation of ruling stopped
In the legal dispute concerning the establishment of terms
and conditions of use by DB Vehicle Maintenance we have
reached an agreement with BNetzA to stop the accelerated
proceedings. BNetz A will abstain from implementing the
ruling until the court of first instance has made a decision
in the main proceedings. In return, DB Vehicle Maintenance
is withdrawing its application for tempor ary legal protection [page 90] .

Intertec merged in joint venture
Intertec Beteiligungs-GmbH and SystemPartner GmbH
&Co. KG (SPA) agreed at the end of January to merge their
activities in SPA as a joint venture under MarkenTechnikService GmbH&Co. KG. DB ML AG will hold a 69% share in the
joint venture.

Association hearing begun
In January 2015 the BMVI began a hearing of associations
on the subject of a law to strengthen competition in the r ailway sector [page 91] . In some areas, the draft goes far
beyond an “as-is” implementation of the specifications
laid out in the recast. For example, there is a tightening
of the regulations concerning fees and a clear expansion
of BNetz A’s competencies. In our view, it must in particular be guaranteed that the new plans for regulation do

not endanger the financing of railway infrastructure and
rail’s intermodal competitive ability. Some extensive adjustments will be necessary to ensure this.
Adoption of this legislation is not expected before the
second half of 2015.

LUFV II signed
Negotiations were concluded in the year under review
on the LuFV II [page 89] and it was signed on January 12,
2015.

Advance payment of collective
bargaining wages
An agreement has not yet been reached in the ongoing
collective bargaining negotiations [page 11 4 f.] . For this rea­
son DB Group is paying an advance to the employees who
are affected by the ongoing round of collective bargaining
negotiations. The advance payment will be offset by
existing or still to be agreed wage regulations.

Swiss franc released
Immediately after the Swiss National Bank gave up its minimum price of CHF 1.20 per euro the Swiss currency gained
almost 35% in value and by mid-February it had settled
onto a level that was about 15% higher than at the end of
2014. This also had an impact on DB Group’s declared debt
position because a portion of the bonds are in Swiss francs.
With appropriate hedging measures, however, a negative
effect could be avoided.

Economic outlook

Future business policy

The outlook for economic development in 2015 is based on
the assumption that there will be no deterioration in the
geopolitical situation.

We want to assert our market positions in the 2015 financial
year and stimulate organic growth in our business units. In
our DB2020
strategy we have defined the strategic directions for the coming years and we have been pursuing these
consistently. We do not intend to make any fundamental
changes to our business policy in the 2015 financial year.

Future strategic focus
Our strategy remains focused on the long-term trends
[page 72 ff.] prevailing in the markets in which we are active.
The DB Group’s strategic objective is laid down in our
DB2020
strategy, which we continued to implement in the
year under review. Our target is to ensure sustainable business success and social acceptance with an entrepreneurial
approach based on sustainability.

Future sales markets
Our opportunities for growth in the German passenger trans­
­port market are limited due to the high level of competition
and restrictions imposed by antitrust laws. As a result, we
are primarily focused on defending our strong market position and strengthening the competitive position of the railways in an intermodal context. Our potential for growth in
the area of passenger transport services lies in other European countries and in cross-border long-distance rail passenger transport services.
In the area of rail freight transport, our focus continues
to be on the European market. We are well positioned in all
of the central European corridors and can offer service connections to locations as far afield as China.
We also do not expect there to be any significant changes
in the freight forwarding and logistics business in the 2015
financial year. DB Schenker Logistics is already well represented in all key markets and regions.

We expect a moderate rise in global economic growth in 2015.
The continuing recovery in the USA and in a few European
countries are contributing to this development. In contrast,
the growth rates in emerging countries, especially Asia, are
already at a much higher level and will hardly increase. The
expansion of global trade should accelerate because curbing
effects, such as weak import demand from the Eurozone,
are gradually diminishing.
One important influential factor for economic developments are interest rates, which have been climbing at some­
­what moderate rates after a long time. The higher interest
rates affect exchange rates, the propensity to consume, and
investments. Moderate economic development, particularly
in the Eurozone and Japan, as well as a few emerging countries, limit the potential for a global rise in interest rates,
however.
The American domestic market remains on a robust path
of growth. Due to gains in competitiveness, the ex­­
pected appreciation of the US dollar may only cause a
slight drop in demand for American products. Declining
oil prices are challenging the fracking industry.
Receding dynamism in emerging countries and continuing weak growth in Europe are also impacting the
US export business.
Economic growth in Asia is expected to remain at a
high, but no longer rising, level in 2015.

>>Dampening effects are coming especially from the re­­ >>Motorized individual transport is profiting in particular
alignment of China’s economic policy towards lower GDP
growth rates, as well as the continuing weakness of the
Japanese economy.
In Europe, the economies of several non-Eurozone countries are growing in 2015 at an above-average rate (espe­
­cially Great Britain and Sweden, as well as several Central
and Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Poland
and the Czech Republic).
The Eurozone should grow more strongly in 2015 than in
previous years. The growth trajectory, however, remains
lower than before the financial crisis.
Reasons for expecting a sluggish recovery are the assump­
­tions that the structural problems of countries such as
France and Italy are not yet resolved, that high levels of
debt continue, and the existence of geopolitical risks
such as the Ukraine crisis.
Germany will most likely grow at a stronger pace than
the Eurozone as a whole in 2015. This development continues to be supported by domestic demand, especially
private consumption and investments.
Exports are also expected to grow strongly, stimulated
by the gradual recovery of important (European) sales
markets and the devaluation of the euro.

There is no indication of significant improvement in economic conditions for the Eurozone. However, the economic
environment improved considerably in several other European countries, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Poland and
the Czech Republic. As in previous years, developments in
the European rail passenger transport market are expected
to vary from one region to another.
We are expecting an increase in volume sold of about
1.0% for passenger transport in Germany in 2015. Although
economic developments are developing less energetically,
the positive structural conditions established in 2014 still
remain valid: stable employment rates, significant increases
in real disposable income, and a low level for (admittedly
vol­­atile) fuel prices. At the same time, competition between
modes of transport will remain intense for the foreseeable
future.

In the German freight transport market in 2015, we are ex­­
­pecting growth to remain at the previous year’s level, therefore a gradual recovery.
Rail freight transport in Germany may return to a growth
trajectory and develop in tandem with the overall market;
growth potential in classic rail-oriented industries, such
as the iron, coal and steel (montan) industry for example,
is limited. Combined transport may expand its role as a
growth engine in the course of further containerization
and dynamic commercial activity.
Road freight transport with slightly weaker growth versus
2014. Positive effects from the construction industry
flattening out, robust domestic market with stable de­­
velopments in the consumer goods industry – which is
important for trucking – may have a supportive effect.
Inland waterway transport expected to have positive
yet still lower-than-average development, diminishing
stimulus from the construction sector may be offset by
such factors as increased volume in the coal sector due
to rising imports through the ARA ports (Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam) as well as shifts in transport.

Due to assumptions regarding economic developments, we
anticipate moderate growth in demand, with varying re­­
gional patterns, in the European rail freight transport market
in 2015.
In view of the economic recovery forecasts, we are ex­­
pecting revenue growth similar to or slightly above the
previous year’s level for the European land transport market
in 2015, with the greatest growth being experienced in
Eastern Europe. We can only expect prices to recover if there
is stable long-term growth in volume due to continuing
strong margin pressure.
Growth similar to or slightly above the previous year’s
level is expected for the global air freight market in 2015.
Because capacity will climb in similar dimensions, we can
also continue to anticipate sufficient freight capacity. Low
freight rates will continue because of excess capacity and
currently low oil prices.
Growth of about 4% is expected in ocean freight for 2015.
The rise in demand will not be sufficient, however, to make
full use of the projected increase in capacity. Low oil prices
could force low freight rates, yet it could come to different
rate developments, depending on the transport area. The
introduction of emissions control areas in Northern Europe
and the Baltic region, as well as the USA and Canada, obligates shipping companies to use fuels with low sulfur content. Shipping companies are passing on these additional
costs to customers in the form of rate surcharges. The new
low sulfur regulations apply as of January 2015.
We are assuming a slightly accelerated market development for contract logistics/SCM in 2015. The expected rise
of about 6% may be buttressed by climbing growth rates
in the core automotive, health care, and industrial industries. The regions with the strongest growth may continue
to be Asia/Pacific, whereby China will continue to play a
prominent role.

Infrastructure
In the passenger transport market in 2015, we expect stable
train-path demand. Due to moderate improvement in the
economy, we anticipate that there will be slight growth in
rail freight transport.
Owing to the increase in regular services, we expect a
moderate increase for station stops as well.
Slightly positive developments are being forecasted for
real retail sales (excluding cars and gas stations) in Germany in 2015. Rental income in stations for 2015 will be
slightly above the previous year’s level.

Anticipated development of the
procurement and financial markets
Procurement markets
We do not expect to encounter any bottlenecks on the
procurement side during the 2015 financial year. Due to a
continuing weakness in demand and excess capacity, all
major institutes foresee an oil market that is more than
adequately provisioned; however, negative surprises remain
possible due to geopolitical risks. We do not expect any
major new stimuli for electricity markets from the revision
of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), yet political
interventions could lead to intermittent price fluctuations.
Overall, we anticipate a moderate rise in energy and raw
material prices.

Financial markets
Monetary policy in Europe, especially the ECB’s decision to
initiate a massive bond-purchasing program, and in the
USA may continue on the same track, meaning that interest
rates in both currency zones will continue to differ strongly.
Sustained higher interest rates are not to be expected in
Europe in this environment. This applies in particular to
bunds, which are in intense demand during geopolitical
crises. In this kind of environment, historically low yields,
despite their low attractiveness, will not prevent continuing interest from investors. Furthermore, ECB actions
are creating even higher demand for bunds. Diverging markets in both currency zones are exposing the euro to additional potential for setbacks vis-a-vis the US dollar.

Anticipated development of important
business conditions
The conclusion of LuFV II [page 89] will influence rail transport as of 2015. Starting in 2015, a rising amount of annual
funding is slated for replacement capital expenditures and
maintenance to preserve the existing network.
Within the scope of transport policy and the regulatory
environment, we must anticipate that the legislative initiatives of the EU Commission relating to the fourth r ailway
pack age [page 91] and preparations for the R ailway Regulation Act [page 91] will have a noticeable impact on our business operations in the future. In view of the current plans,
however, we do not expect any concrete measures to affect
the 2015 financial year in a major way.

The volume sold in the DB Bahn Long-Distance and DB Bahn
Regional business units should once more increase overall
in the 2015 financial year as a result of improvements in the
quality of the services provided. Train-path demand should
increase slightly once more in the 2015 financial year due
to a forecasted increase in demand from rail freight transport, while the trend towards a continual increase in trainpath demand on the part of non-DB Group customers is set
to persist.
Further improvements in economic and market expectations are also reflected in the expectation of improved performance by DB Schenker Logistics. We expect all lines of
business to experience growth surpassing that of the market.
Customer and quality

F3
P. 180
P. 182

We expect a slight improvement in customer satisfaction,
among both private and business customers.
∫ The degree of punctuality achieved by our rail transport services should continue to improve in the 2015 financial year, even if part of the improvements in performance
quality are offset by high levels of construction activity in
the network.
Several campaigns have been planned or are already in
implementation for the stabilization and sustainable im­­
provement of customer satisfaction and product quality in
2015:
DB Bahn Long-Distance

>>The new ICE portal offers our customers information on
current travel, such as route information, information
on delays and possible connections, reminders to exit
the train at your destination, and entertainment (films
and video games). It will also be possible to order service

DB Bahn Regional

>>Our focus here is on the mobile terminal for customer
service representatives, which enables a completely new
concept of accelerated sales and verification processes.
At the same time, alternative traveler information systems are being introduced in the vehicles, enabling faster
and more precise communication of real-time data and
connection options.
The “ridesharing app” (Mitfahrer-App) will improve the
attractiveness of the state-wide “Federal State Ticket,”
the “Cross-Country Ticket,” and the “Happy Weekend
Ticket,” by enabling customers to take shared advantage of ridesharing benefits in a much simpler way.
“Mobility integration,” the central innovation project, is
targeting the networking of mobility services in rural
areas. Public bus transport and need-based services are
being brought together, as core public transport services, with services from private car-sharing agencies,
health-related transport services, and even commercial
transport options, such as courier services. DB Bahn
Regional is investing in the necessary IT infrastructure
and making partnership agreements with local mobility
partners.

DB Arriva

>>DB Arriva will continue to focus its innovations on the
customer in 2015. Numerous projects are planned, both
for services in Great Britain as well as on the European
continent.
DB Schenker Rail

>>In addition to further improvement in the stability and
quality of production – the major drivers of customer
satisfaction – preparations for the introduction of network rail are a priority for 2015. The service catalog will
be introduced in Germany, and customers will be prepared or processed for the migration to network rail.
DB Schenker Logistics

oped in a market-oriented manner, and there will be close

∫ Measures are being undertaken to minimize the effects
of increased construction volume due to LuFV II [page 89]
as much as possible. We are stocking up planning capac­
­ity so that even more construction can be considered in
timetable planning, and the construction site planning
is being further optimized so that even higher construction volumes can be carried out during shutdown periods.

DB Netze Stations

>>The installation of digital visual displays at stations will
continue. By the end of 2015, 6,500 digital visual displays
will be installed at 4,200 stations.
Journey information will still be developed according to
the two-sense principle. By the end of 2015, nearly every
station will be equipped with the respective electronic
journey information technology.

Profitable growth

The development as presented below is based on our expectations regarding market, competition and environmental
developments, as well as the successful implementation of
planned measures. These assumptions and estimates are
subject to an increasing degree of uncertainty with an in­­­
creasing time horizon. Given that only the budget for the
2015 financial year and no medium-term planning (MTP)
had yet been approved by the Supervisory Board at the
time of the preparation, this report does not contain any
projections with respect to the 2016 financial year.

Following the poor development recorded in the year under
review, we anticipate that the financial position will develop
in a slightly positive manner in the 2015 financial year.
The DB Schenker Logistics, DB Schenker Rail and DB Arriva
business units in particular will be the drivers in revenue
growth.
In terms of profits, we expect that revenue gains will only
be mirrored in developments in a disproportionately low
way. Adverse effects from such factors as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) surcharge are becoming
noticeable, as are our programs for improving product
quality and punctuality.
The ROCE is expected at best to stay constant at the
previous year’s level as a result of the slightly positive
development of adjusted EBIT in conjunction with an
increase in capital employed.
Redemption coverage is set to decrease slightly on the
basis of an increase in net financial debt.

We once again anticipate a slight increase in revenues in

and should also offset the rising level of expenses, with the
result that the adjusted EBIT figure should slightly exceed
the level of the previous year.

In the DB Bahn Regional business unit, we expect stable

the further implementation of the “Action Plan for Germany.”

DB Schenker Logistics

We anticipate that the DB Schenker Logistics business unit
will once again experience additional growth driven by
both volume and pricing effects in the 2015 financial year.
This development should also have a positive impact on
adjusted EBIT.
DB Services

Fall in demand may lead to negative developments in revenues and profits in the DB Services business unit.
DB Netze Track

We expect a positive revenue development in the DB Netze
Track business unit in the 2015 financial year due to volume
and price effects. This should also be reflected in the development of adjusted EBIT.

We have already made considerable progress in improving
our employer attractiveness. Demographic change will further intensify competition on the labor market because the
supply of potential employees will become smaller in the
future for all target groups, and other corporations are re­­
lying more intensively on employer branding and recruiting
activities. We therefore have to act to defend our good
position in employer rankings in the short-term and then
expand our position step by step, so that by 2020 we will be
among Germany’s top ten employers.
We have gradually increased our share of women in
recent years, which is an important component of our readiness for demographic change. We are expecting a slight
increase in 2015. Various measures have been implemented
for a further increase to 25%. We expect the full effect of
these measures to unfold as of 2016.
It is also our target to maintain stability in terms of health
rate against the background of demographic change.
As of the 2015 financial year, the new staffing needs cover age r atio [page 81] replaces the former key performance
indicator of covering of external staffing needs.

DB Netze Stations

In the DB Netze Stations business unit, revenues in the 2015
financial year should be greater than in the previous year
due to pricing effects, and this development will also have
a positive impact on profit, which is likely to exceed the pre­
­vious year’s level.
DB Netze Energy

In the DB Netze Energy business unit, revenue development may be driven primarily by stationary energy products.
Together with counteractive measures that have been
introduced, this should also lead to a positive result.

rises in green energy volume due to the Renewable Energy
Sources Act (EEG) allocation mechanism. We are currently
working on establishing new goals. We are on target for
our noise protection plans. Keeping our recycling rate at a
high level continues to be a major challenge.

We will continue on our course of modernization with high
levels of capital expenditures. This will likely once more be
above the level of the year under review in the 2015 financial year. We will continue to focus our capital expenditures
activities on rail infrastructure. In the 2015 financial year,
we intend to invest a total of about € 4.7 billion, including
investment grants, in the renovation and renewal of existing
lines, facilities and technology. This includes the additional
funds that the Federal Government is providing through the
LuFV [page 89], which was extended to 2019. Vehicle capital
expenditures are expected to decrease yet remain at a high
level in 2015 after the strong increase during the year under
review. This led to a decrease in net capital expenditures.

Efficient liquidity management is once again a top priority
for us in the 2015 financial year. We are focusing on continually forecasting the cash flow from our operating activities,
as this is our main source of cash and cash equivalents. We
produce liquidity forecasts every month on the basis of a
12-month liquidity plan. In the 2015 financial year, we must
redeem financial liabilities (excluding commercial paper
and current bank liabilities) amounting to about € 1.1 billion.
The need for cash and cash equivalents will be offset by
the issue of public and private bonds, with roadshows in
Europe and Asia planned.
We anticipate that the structure of the liabilities side of
the balance sheet will remain essentially unchanged despite
the financing measures, as these will primarily serve to
re­finance expiring financial debt. Our debt issuance and commercial paper progr ams [page 99 f.] remain a source of sufficient financing for our capital market activities, with our
guaranteed credit facilities [page 99] serving as a fallback

should our access to the capital markets be blocked. Our
short-term and medium-term liquidity supply is therefore
also secure in the 2015 financial year.
The majority of our gross capital expenditures in the
2015 financial year will again be covered by investment
grants. Net capital expenditures to be financed by DB Group
are expected to rise considerably in the 2015 financial year,
with the result that it will probably not be possible to
entirely fund our net capital expenditures from internal
sources of financing. Net financial debt as of December 31,
2015 is therefore likely to be higher than at the end of the
year under review.
We will continue our M&A activities in a selective and
focused manner in the 2015 financial year. We do not expect
these activities to have any significant impact on our financial position in the 2015 financial year.

Overall statement of the
Management Board regarding the
economic development of DB Group
Following the weak development in the year under review,
the Management Board of DB AG anticipates that DB Group
will develop in an overall slightly positive manner in the
2015 financial year. The increase in revenues will also be
noticeable despite cost impairments.
We expect to have excellent access to the capital market
in the 2015 financial year.
Our activities are subject to various risks, as elucidated
in the Opportunity and Risk report [page 168 ff.]. With respect
to the 2015 financial year, we consider that our greatest risk
exposure relates to personnel and regulatory requirements.
The Management Board believes that DB Group has
taken all necessary measures to protect itself against
existing risks and to be able to exploit possible opportunities. We want to further expand our market position and
implement our strategy. We therefore consider the overall
outlook for DB Group in the medium term to be favorable.

This management report contains statements and forecasts pertaining to the future
development of DB Group, its business units and individual companies. These forecasts
are estimates made based on information that was available at the time. Actual developments and profits may diverge from the current expectations as a result of the nonmaterialization of the assumptions upon which our forecasts are based or the materialization
of risks such as those presented in the Risk report.

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed in the following.
a) Impairment of cash-generating unit
DB Group carries out a test to establish whether there is an impairment

of a year if there are any major events or changes to assumptions, and
is updated where necessary. Fundamental principles and assumptions
of the impairment procedure used in DB Group in accordance with IAS 36
(Impairment of Assets) are detailed in the section “Accounting and valuation methods” under the heading “Impairments of assets.” The main
assumptions which have an impact on the value of a CGU are reviewed in
the form of standard sensitivity analyses.
Possible effects on the value of selected CGUs may also result from
the current business model discussions for the DB Bahn Long-Distance
segment, the results of which are to be discussed in the course of the
first half of 2015 in the Supervisory Board of DB AG. In the current assessment, all currently discussed scenarios assure the value of business in
the Long-Distance CGU and also the other CGUs affected by potential
changes.

In the year under review, revenues increased by € 621 million (+1.6%) to
€ 39,728 million). This revenue growth compared with the previous year
is mainly attributable to DB Arriva, DB Schenker Logistics and the infrastructure companies. At DB Arriva, the higher farebox revenues, currency

negatively affected by the strike action of the GDL trade union and the
Ela storm, without which the growth in revenue would have been much
more significant. In the DB Bahn Long-Distance segment, the competition
posed by the long-distance bus market and the changed price/performance perception of customers have had a negative impact on the development in revenues. Adjusted by effects from changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rates, the increase in revenues was 1.9%.
The slight decline in concession fees for rail transport as a result of
the GDL strike is attributable to the DB Bahn Regional segment. On the
other hand, DB Arriva has reported a slight increase.

the year under review, the other assets include customs receivables
of € 124 million of the DB Schenker Logistics segment. In the
previous year, such receivables (€ 100 million) had been shown as
trade receivables.

Individual allowances are created in relation to receivables if there are
objective indications of an impairment. In the case of identical receivables
(portfolios of receivables) which cannot be identified as impaired individually, global allowances (based on experience) are recognized on the
basis of the age structure of such receivables. Any impairments which
are recognized are deducted from financial assets on the assets side of
the balance sheet. Previous impairments are reversed if the reasons for
the original impairments are no longer applicable.

The payments from energy derivatives are recognized in the income
statement in the periods in which they fall due.
In the case of interest and cross-currency hedges, the effectiveness
of the hedge is assessed prospectively using the Critical Terms Match
method. This method is used because the major valuation parameters
of the underlying and hedges are identical. The effectiveness is mea-

hedge is assessed prospectively using the linear regression. The retrospective effectiveness measurement is carried out as of every balance
sheet date by means of linear regression. The ineffectiveness is also calculated using the dollar-offset method. Under this method, the changes
in the market values of the underlying are compared with the changes in
the market value of the hedging instrument. The resultant quotient determines the inefficiency.
The inefficiencies of cash flow hedges of the energy price derivatives
recognized in the income statement amounted to € 0 million in the year
under review (previous year: € 0 million).

kets. In exceptional cases and to a limited extent, subsidiaries are permitted to hedge foreign currency positions with banks themselves.
In order to present foreign currency risks, IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity
analysis which investigates the effects of theoretical changes in foreign
currency relations on result and shareholders’ equity.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:

>> The cross-currency swaps which are concluded and the current currency transactions are always allocated to non-derivative underlyings.

>> All major foreign currency positions arising from operating activities
are always 100% hedged. If exchange rate changes are 100% hedged,
they do not have any impact on results or capital.

>> Foreign currency risks can only occur if a 100% hedge does not exist

Diesel price risks are for instance limited by taking out diesel swaps
(hybrid hedges of diesel price and currency risks and individual hedges
of currency risks are possible in exceptional cases).
Energy price risks are quantified by means of sensitivity analyses in
accordance with IFRS 7. These provide information concerning the effects
of theoretical energy price changes on result and shareholders’ equity
(in relation to the balance sheet exposure on the balance sheet date).
The following assumptions have been made for performing the sensitivity analyses:

>> In the case of energy price swaps, the effective part is recognized in
shareholders’ equity, and the ineffective part is recognized in the
income statement.

DB Group has claims against contract partners. The counterparty default

risk is monitored and actively managed by way of strict requirements
relating to the creditworthiness of the counterparty at the point at
which the transactions are concluded and also throughout the entire life
of the transactions, and also by way of defining risk limits.
In order to minimize the credit risk of long-term derivative transactions, DB Group has concluded credit support agreements (CSA) with its
core banks. In the CSA , it was agreed that both parties would mutually
provide cash securities for interest and cross-currency swaps as well as
energy derivatives. Securities are exchanged daily with all relevant banks.

We were unable to meet our target of reducing fatal occupational accidents in the year under review. The results show us which activities
deserve our intense attention. Fatal accidents occurred in the vicinity of
tracks and were caused by unforeseeable and dangerous situations. Immediate awareness-raising measures were introduced to all of those involved.
The occupational accident rate in our accident statistics for Germany
reveal that our efforts in recent years have built a strong foundation.
Nevertheless, we still want to work on creative ideas, technological innovations, and new occupational health and safety targets. The evaluation

for the climate protection target
‡

The climate protection target describes the development of specific

CO ₂ emissions in certain business units on the basis of methodical emis-

sions. Each year, the recorded specific emissions per business unit are
“converted” into methodical emissions on the basis of volume sold/
produced for the benchmark year of 2006. This holds the relationship of
the business units constant with each other.
For the calculation of specific indicators for the actual year, we consider the combustion-related CO ₂ emissions of our own vehicles (Scope 1),

DB Group is globally active in over 130 countries at over
2,000 locations. The associated consumption of water is
done almost exclusively with public or private water suppliers
and generally includes drinking water supply as well as
water provisions for sanitary purposes and cleaning processes. DB Group is not aware of any circumstances that
suggest a significant impact to the water sources used.
Insofar as, beyond the supply of actual operating locations,
temporary water extractions in the course of construction
projects on transport infrastructure operated by DB Group
results in a significant effect on the respective water source,
these activities are subject to the usual permit and supervisory
legal regulations. There is no central register of the groundwater volumes that are moved and then redirected or drained.

No materials that harm the ozone layer are released in
DB Group’s production processes.
All relevant combustion-related emissions that arise during
the provisioning of transport and mobility services are
reported. POPs are not released at all in regular processes,
and VOCs are not released in relevant volumes. VOCs arise
in cleaning and coloring processes, are within statutory
limits, and occur both directly and in diffusion.
Total water extraction and total water discharge are reported
together in the form of consumed water because, due to
DB Group production processes, there is no essential difference between extraction and discharge.
The water discharge of DB Group is handled in accordance
with applicable statutes and compliance with the limit
values for the discharge of wastewater are regularly analyzed
by accredited laboratories. The treated wastewater is discharged primarily into public sewer systems. We are not
aware of direct discharge of wastewater (aside from rain runoff water).

(according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol)

Product for freight transport customers that en­­
sures their goods are transported CO₂-free by rail
on all routes within Germany.

Means of active protection against noise generated
on rail lines, mainly constructed out of materials
such as aluminum, wood and concrete. Novel are
noise barriers constructed out of wire cages filled
with rocks (gabions).

In carbon accounting, emissions are categorized in
three “scopes.” The following applies at DB Group:
Scope 1 = CO₂ emissions from our own vehicles;
Scope 2 = traction current provisioning; Scope
3 = transport services from our subcontractors. Be­­
cause of our business model, Scope 3 only includes
transport-related emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emissions from processes not
related to transport are not considered in the climate protection target.

Equity method

This encompasses property, plant and equipment
(including intangible assets) and net working
capital.

Process of treating subsidiaries that are to be
included in the consolidated financial statements
with all assets and liabilities on a basis of full consolidation. The investment book value of the in­­
vestment is adjusted to reflect the development
of the pro rata share of equity.

Commercial paper program (CP program)
Contractual framework or standard documentation for the issue of short-term debt issues.

Costs of capital
Minimum required return, calculated based on
market values as the weighted average cost of
debt and equity capital.

Credit facilities
Lines of credit provided by banks that can be
tapped into as required. These are agreed lines of
credit with different maturities that serve in part
as available liquidity reserves, while “umbrella
credit lines” are available in particular to foreign
subsidiaries as financing for working capital and
as a guarantee reserve.

Debt issuance program
Contractual framework or standard documentation for the issue of bonds. Provides a high degree
of flexibility in issuing activity.

Derivative financial instruments (derivatives)
Derivatives are financial instruments for which
the price or value depends on the future prices of
other goods, assets or benchmarks (interest rates,
indices). These are contracts where the parties
agree to buy, sell or swap assets in the future at
certain conditions, or to provide alternative payment of the notional amount.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
Operating profit before the subtraction of interest
and taxes.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA)
Operating profit before the subtraction of interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Equity ratio
Financial ratio based on the balance sheet structure: share of total assets equal to equity, expressed
as a percentage.

Net financial debt
The total of interest-bearing external liabilities
and finance lease liabilities as well as cash and
cash equivalents and interest-bearing external
receivables.

Operate leases
Off-balance-sheet financial instruments: leased or
rented assets.

Operating income after interest

Key financial performance indicator that provides
a structural indicator of the ratio of net financial
debt to equity, expressed as a percentage.

Profits indicator that also takes into account costs
of financing in order to be able to assess earnings
in the long term (mainly important in the Infrastructure business units). In contrast to EBIT, the
net operating interest income is also taken into
account when calculating this figure.

Gross capital expenditures

Plan assets

Gearing

Total expenditures for property, plant and equipment and assets, regardless of financing method.

Gross profit
Amount of revenues remaining after the subtraction of the variable (= revenues-based) costs or
direct (= order-based) costs.

Interest-free loans
A loan from the Federal Government that is to be
repaid but is not subject to interest. These emerge
from financial participation of the German Federal
Government in capital expenditures in the expansion and replacement of rail infrastructure.

International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS)
Internationally recognized accounting standards.
The term IFRS is used to refer to the global language for business affairs approved by the International Accounting Standards Board in 2002.
Standards approved prior to this are still cited as
International Accounting Standards (IAS).

Investment grants
Financial participation of third parties in specific
capital expenditure projects without future repayment requirements.

Net capital expenditures
Gross capital expenditure minus third-party investment grants; for example, for infrastructure capital
expenditures.

Assets netted with gross pension obligations.

Ratings
An assessment of creditworthiness issued by
rating agencies that affects the refinancing options
available to a company and the associated costs.

Redemption coverage
Key financial performance indicator showing the
ratio between ongoing financial power and the
financial obligations of the company (adjusted net
financial debt).

Return on capital employed (ROCE)
Key ratio used for value-oriented management.
Corresponds to the return on operational capital
employed. Ratio of (adjusted) EBIT to capital em­­
ployed, expressed as a percentage.

Scope of consolidation
The subsidiaries within a group that are included
in the consolidated financial statements.

Swap
A swap is a financial transaction based on the
exchange of future payment flows. This enables
the targeted hedging of financial risks (interest,
currency risks, raw materials).
