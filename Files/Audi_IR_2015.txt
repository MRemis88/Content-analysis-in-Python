Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report
To AUDI AG, Ingolstadt
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the
sustainability information marked with “ ” in the interim reporting of sustainability information (hereafter the “Interim Report”) of AUDI AG, Ingolstadt
(hereafter the “Company”) for the business year from January 1st, to December
31st, 2015.1
Management’s Responsibility
Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the
Interim Report in accordance with the relevant criteria regarding the scope of our
review (completeness, clarity, accuracy, timeliness, comparability and reliability),
as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) (hereafter the “relevant Criteria”) and for the selection of the information to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods
to prepare the Interim Report as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for
individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the present circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and
maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Interim
Report, which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional
standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors
and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und
vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the joint opinion of the Wirtschaftsprüferkammer (Chamber of German Public Auditors; WPK) and the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW):
Requirements to quality control for audit firms (“Gemeinsamen Stellungnahme
der WPK und des IDW: Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis”: “VO 1/2006”) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information
marked with “ ” in the Interim Report based on our work performed.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” published by IAASB.
This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to
obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that
cause us to believe that the sustainability information marked with “ ” in the
Interim Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the relevant Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more
limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly
less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The
procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement. This includes the
assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information marked with “ ” in the Interim Report with regard to the relevant Criteria.

1

Our assurance engagement applies to the German version of the Interim Report.

Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
• Inquiries of personnel at the corporate head office and at the production site
in Ingolstadt in charge of the data collection and consolidation of sustainability information regarding the underlying internal control system and
selected information in the Interim Report
• Inspection of supplemental documents and supporting systems
• Analytical procedures on selected sustainability information of the Interim
Report
• Comparison of selected sustainability information with corresponding data in
the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report
• Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information in the
Interim Report regarding the sustainability performance
• Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of information in the
Interim Report concerning fleet emissions and fuel consumption as well as
comparison of selected information on fleet emissions and fuel consumption
with the official documents of the certification authorities
Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the sustainability information marked with “ ” in
the Interim Report of the Company for the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2015 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the relevant Criteria.
Additional Notice – Interim Reporting
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the fact that as pointed
out by AUDI AG in the printed version of the Interim Report, the Interim Report
does not represent a complete sustainability reporting in accordance with the
G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. The
Interim Report is essentially the update of last year’s key performance indicators.
Against the backdrop of the diesel emissions issue it would have been required for
a complete sustainability reporting, as envisaged in the reporting year 2016, to
adequately consider the diesel emissions issue on the basis of an updated materiality analysis.
Restriction on Use and Distribution
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with AUDI AG. The
review has been performed for purposes of AUDI AG and is merely intended to
inform AUDI AG about the results of the review. The report is not intended for any
third parties to base any (financial) decision thereon. Our responsibility pertains
solely towards the AUDI AG. We do not assume any responsibility towards third
parties.
